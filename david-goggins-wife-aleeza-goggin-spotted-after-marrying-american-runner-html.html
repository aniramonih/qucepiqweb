Unlike her famous ex-husband, she has kept her life away from the public eye, making it challenging to find information about her parents, siblings, and education. Aleeza is a private and introverted person, preferring to keep her personal matters confidential.

In contrast, David Goggins, her ex-husband, not only excelled as an athlete but also made a name for himself as a motivational speaker and author. His book ‘Can’t Hurt Me Back,’ released in 2018, became immensely popular nationwide.

Despite a significant age difference, with David being ten years younger, their love for each other initially led them to marriage without regard for age. Reports suggest that it was Aleeza who initiated the separation. One cited reason for their mutual decision to divorce was their dissatisfaction with their intimate life, leading to ongoing relationship struggles and unhappiness. Another factor that contributed to their divorce was David’s alleged affair with a famous Olympic gymnast, which became public knowledge prior to their separation.
