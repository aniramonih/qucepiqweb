To see it, open your menu and use your ZL and ZR buttons to move over to the tab with the Wi-Fi symbol on it. Here, there will be an option for "Lost & Found" and "Mystery Gifts." You will need internet access to collect any of your gifts.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do I activate my Mystery Gift in 'Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus'?</h2><p>Once you've unlocked the page to access your Mystery Gifts, redeeming them is simple.

These can only be used once and cannot be shared.</p><p>Anyone who plays the game and makes it through the fifth main quest before May 9, 2022, will have the option to redeem a Fancy Kimono, Fancy Bottoms, and a Baneful Fox Mask.
