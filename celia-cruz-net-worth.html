Even with opposition from her mother, Cruz managed to learn Santeria which is a religious language used in songs. She also learned the West African language, Yoruba and made various recordings of the songs she learned. Her father had originally intended for Celia to become a teacher, but after learning from a teacher how much the entertainment industry earns, she went on to pursue a singing career. One of her first widespread performances would be singing for the popular radio station program “Hora del Te’”, on which she would win first place and get a cake. She continued to enter competitions, winning and qualifying herself for other contests.</p><p>During the 1950s and 60s, Celia joined the group Sonora Matancera and their popularity earned them cameos for various films like “Amorcito Corazon” and “Rincon Criollo”. Around this period, <a href=#>Fidel Castro</a> had assumed control of Cuba, and as part of his reign prohibited Celia from returning to her homeland. She and her husband would become citizens of the United States, and Cruz would continue to make music and albums. Celia created eight albums for Tico Records and then later joined the Vaya Records Label. In 1974, Cruz created an album with Johnny Pacheco called “Celia y Johnny”, which would become extremely popular and gave Celia the opportunity to become a part of the “Fania All-Stars”. The orchestral group would travel around the world to perform at countries like England, France and the Congo.</p><p>Aside from her music and albums, Celia had the opportunity to become a part of a documentary called “Salsa” which was about Latin culture. She also did spots and commercials for the radio, mostly doing songs or jingles for various companies. Another film she was featured in was “The Mambo Kings” with <a href=#>Armand Assante</a> and <a href=#>Antonio Banderas</a>.</p><p>Throughout her career, Cruz was awarded multiple times for her music. She received a Grammy for the Best Tropical Performance alongside Ray Barretto. She was also given the National Medal of Arts by <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a> and was inducted into the Billboards Latin Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>It is known that Cruz was married to Pedro Knight fom 1962, and they lived together in the United States after the prohibition in Cuba. Later in Celia’s life she was diagnosed with brain cancer and eventually succumbed to it on 16 July 2003. More than 200,000 fans went to her funeral and burial while vigils happened across the globe. One famous vigil was the “Cali Vigil’ in Colombia which lasted for three days.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.802017654477><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 21, 1925, Havana, Cuba</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>July 16, 2003, Fort Lee, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Cuban-American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Pedro Knight (m. 1962–2003)</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0190272</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>National Medal of Arts (1994), Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Performance (1990), International Latin Music Hall of Fame (1999), "La Guarachera de Cuba"</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>Tico Records, Vaya Records</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Albums</td><td>La "Ritmo En El Corazon" (2089), "Siempre Viviré" (2001),Negra Tiene Tumbao (2002,2003), Celia Cruz and Friends: A Night of Salsa(2000), Regalo del Alma (2004), “Celia y Johnny” (1974)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Sonora Matancera</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>“The Mambo Kings”, “Amorcito Corazon”, “Rincon Criollo” (1950-1960), “Salsa”</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Hora del Te", “Fania All-Stars”</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/4714807_Celia-Cruz/4714807_The-Mummys-Revenge-1975.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpycpaGRYrCzwdlmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cathy-nesbitt-stein-htm.html><span>←</span><span>Cathy Nesbitt-Stein - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</span></a>
