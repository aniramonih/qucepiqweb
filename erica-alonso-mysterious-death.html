Her family‚Äôs harrowing experience inspired them to start a never-ending search for the truth and justice.</p><p>The whole country came together to support them in their quest for solutions. Even with all the attention, people concerned are still baffled by the mystery surrounding Erica‚Äôs tragic death.</p><p>Let us take a closer look at the circumstances and incidents that led up to Erica Alonso‚Äôs passing.</p><h3>Erica Alonso‚Äôs Night Out with Her Ex-Boyfriend</h3><p>In order to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day in 2015, Erica Alonso spent the evening with her ex-boyfriend Larry.</p><p>However, according to Larry‚Äôs memory, they got into an argument, which led Erica to leave his house alone at 3:45 in the morning in her white 2014 Honda Civic.</p><p>Erica ran into another couple that evening at the Sutra Lounge in Costa Mesa; they subsequently went back to Larry‚Äôs apartment.</p><p>At the time of the investigation, however, there was no reason to suspect anything because their answers coincided with Larry‚Äôs version of what happened.</p><h3>The Mysterious Disappearance of Erica Alonso</h3><p>Her family became worried when Erica Alonso did not come home, so they started looking for her.</p><p>No significant leads materialized despite the family‚Äôs $5000 reward offer for any pertinent information or sightings of Erica at the nightclub.</p><p>When Erica‚Äôs abandoned car with all of her personal stuff inside was found about a mile from her home, the investigation into what happened became more urgent.</p><p>Erica‚Äôs family continued to call for police to look into the case throughout this time, stating their concerns about her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs possible involvement.</p><p>Despite being a subject of interest, there was no solid proof that connected him to Erica‚Äôs disappearance.</p><p>Erica Alonso‚Äôs body was found near the Ortega Highway in Cleveland National Forest some months later, in a chilling discovery. Her lifeless corpse, wrapped in plastic bags and duct tape, added to the confusion and created additional concerns.</p><p dir=ltr lang=zxx><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QLycQqGiDq</a></p><p>‚Äî OC Sheriff, CA (@OCSheriff) <a href=#>June 14, 2023</a></p><p>Since her cause of death was judged to be an accidental overdose, suspicions of foul play were stoked by the secluded spot where her body was discovered, miles from both her home and automobile.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=#>@OCSheriff</a> I am asking that you please take the time to reconsider all the evidence in the murder of Erica Alonso. Her killer is still free, and it‚Äôs clear that one individual is responsible. The disposal of her body was intentional, and justice must be served.</p><p>‚Äî Lordan Jopez (@LordanJopez) <a href=#>June 20, 2023</a></p><h3>Erica Alonso‚Äôs Autopsy Report</h3><p>According to the autopsy report, Erica Alonso had a fatal concoction of alcohol and GHB in her body. GHB, commonly referred to as the ‚Äúdate r*pe drug,‚Äù has sedative and euphoric properties and is occasionally used for recreational purposes.</p><p>Despite the fact that her blood alcohol level was almost three times the legal limit in California, the coroner‚Äôs authorities determined that she overdosed accidentally.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=#>@OCSheriff</a> I am asking that you please take the time to reconsider all the evidence in the murder of Erica Alonso.
