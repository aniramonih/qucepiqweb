I’m just a host briefly, or whatever, but I have a pitch I think maybe we take these three things and exchange them for the safe return of <strong>Shelly</strong> <strong>Miscavige</strong>.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Shelly Miscavige is the wife of Scientology leader <strong>David</strong> <strong>Miscavige</strong>, but Shelly has not been seen in public in many years. In fact, former Scientology member <strong>Leah</strong> <strong>Remini</strong> has often <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>questioned Shelly’s whereabouts</a>. And Tom is a member of the religion, so it was a clear dig at the actor and the religion he practices.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I saw THE FABELMANS with Kanye and it actually changed everything for him," Carmichael says after mentioning Spielberg. At this point, you have to think that every time Jerrod calls out someone's name in the crowd they're halfway to bolting for the door.

While talking to Steven from up on stage, Jerrod said, “I saw [your movie] The Fabelmans with Kanye and it actually changed everything for him.” Steven loved the joke, put up prayer hands and laughed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Then, Jerrod went in for a shot at Will Smith, saying that the actor was awarded with an honorary “<strong>Rock</strong> <strong>Hudson</strong> Award” for displaying masculinity on TV — a clear dig at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his 2022 Oscars slap</a>. Rock Hudson was a very handsome actor who represented the Hollywood ideal of American masculinity during the midcentury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5BpZqOdoqe8pXnCmqmmoZOdrqa4jJ2grKuVqHq1u8xmmqutmaiybrfAp7CeZaeawLV51qKjpWWjora1tIygpqWclaN6qLjOm5ysZWJlf3R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-j-t-taylor-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>James J T Taylor Net Worth How Much is James J T Taylor Worth?</span></a>
