So of course, viewers can’t help but wonder about Perdita’s personal life. Amid talk of a husband and a disability, we address the rumors about Perdita top to bottom and clear the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Perdita Weeks doesn't have a husband, but she has been rumored to have one over the years.</h2><p>Many celebrity relationship websites claimed years ago that Perdita isn't just married, but that she also has two kids. She was linked to a man named Kit Frederiksen, whose existence has since been debunked. That’s right, not only is Perdita not married, but her alleged husband isn’t even a real person or someone she dated! Apparently, various sources used photos of Michelle Mulitz’s husband, <a href=#>Ben Feldman</a>, as Kit to further the rumors.</p><p>At one point, the marriage rumors ran so rampant that Perdita had to debunk them herself. She wrote on Twitter in 2019 and explained that the rumors weren't true.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you have to spend your Monday morning reporting the myriad false mentions on the internet of your “husband” and “children”.

A consistent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> user, she’s always updating us on her adventures, which often include hiking and other outdoor activities. In fact, she posts frequently with her co-star, Jay, so maybe there's a chance for a real-life showmance. But for now, the Miggy love is more than enough for us!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There have also been rumors that Perdita Weeks has a disability.</h2><p>The internet sure does love starting baseless rumors. While there’s definitely nothing wrong with having a disability, Magnum P.I. fans and other fans of Perdita were convinced that she had a disability in real-life after a very believable Season 2 performance. In Season 2, Episode 13, “Mondays Are for Murder,” Perdita’s character Higgins fakes an injury to avoid being partnered with a spy named Thomas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Magnum eventually partners with Higgins, and she’s forced to actually act out this injury, which also weakens her movement skills. She was so good at portraying this fake injury that viewers began wondering if Perdita had an injury or disability of her own. Since then, the rumors still have yet to die down, but it seems like there’s no truth to them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The only truth to the story is that Perdita is just such an adept physical actor, she has tricked everyone into thinking she really does have difficulty moving.</p><p>New episodes of Magnum P.I. air every Sunday at 10 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p>Latest <strong>Magnum P.I.</strong> News and Updates</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbKzsMitmGavlZq4tHnHrqqbmZ6Z</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diplo-denies-being-in-a-romantic-or-sexual-relationship-with-a-19-year-old-tiktoker.html><span>←</span><span>Diplo denies being in a romantic or sexual relationship with a 19-year-old TikToker</span></a>
