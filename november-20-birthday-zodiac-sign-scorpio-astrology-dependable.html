You are loyal to family or to those who love you. If today is your birthday, you are highly <a href=#>receptive and passionate</a>.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>Additionally, you can possess intuitive qualities that make you popular when it comes to being a trusted friend. This <a href=#>Scorpio birthday</a> is very charming and alluring. However, you can overdo it, you go to the extreme every so often, Scorpio.</p><h2><span>Astrology</span></h2><p>The November 20th astrology analysis predicts that underneath that quiet exterior can be a hot-headed and <a href=#>impulsive individual</a>. You tend to take pleasure in living a comfortable life.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>It then affords you the option to be of help to others. There is one setback to this, and that is you tend to be clingy. Yes…there are times when you are to the breaking point of being intrusive, jealous, and obsessive.</p><p>Otherwise, you have a good heart. The future of a person who was born on November 20 shows that you are too nice for your own good. That’s just like you… a Scorpio. This could be a disadvantage if you were in positions of <a href=#>management or leadership</a>.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>You love the feeling of having power over others or rather having others dependent on you. Having these emotions, you may find it difficult to get over hurt feelings, especially those resulting from the act of betrayal.</p><p>The November 20th <a href=#>love compatibility</a> predicts that this Scorpio lover is a puzzling individual. Initially, it’s difficult to commit but once you decide to be with one person, you devote yourself to that one person only. Your partner should be a good listener and tactful.</p><h2><span>Personality</span></h2><p>In the bedroom, the November 20 birthday personality should be, above all things, passionate and open to trying new things. You couldn’t go wrong if you were thinking about becoming involved with someone born on this zodiac birthday. On the other hand, you should not play deceitful love games with this Scorpion. Although the scorpion may seem fragile and even harmless, its sting can <a href=#>prove to be dangerous</a>.</p><p>When it comes to your health, you seem to get it. You take care of your body, mind, and soul. You take measures to develop your inner self, maturing into a strong emotionally, and physically balanced individual. Additionally, you follow a nutritious and wholesome diet. What’s more to say than kudos, Scorpio?</p><p>What’s most important to someone born on a November 20 birthday is family or those they love. You have dreams and aspirations. As an <a href=#>enterprising person</a>, it is highly possible that you could turn a hobby into a lucrative profession. The difficulty lies in deciding on which goal or cause to pursue.</p><p>You realize that it may not happen when you feel it should but rather at the time that change should happen. You are practical, logical, and have a great understanding of nature. Some things are beyond your control, so you don’t spend your wheels worrying about those situations.</p><h2><span>Horoscope</span></h2><p>The November 20 horoscope shows that you are a dependable, sensible but occasionally careless person. As a lover or as a friend, you may find it hard to let go and let people in, but once you <a href=#>make up your mind</a>, relationships generally last.</p><p>Those of you born today are likely health-conscious individuals who could live for a long time. Your spiritual values and practices enable you to live an almost stress-free life. Overall, anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend, family member, business associate, or life partner.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/november20scorpiobirthdaycalendar.jpg alt="november 20 scorpio birthday calendar" width=450 height=281 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span><strong>Famous People And Celebrities Born On&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>November 20</strong></span></h3><p>Duane Allman, <a href=#>Joe Biden</a>, Future, Robert F Kennedy, Dick Smothers, Nadine Velazquez, Ming-Na Wen</p><p>See: <a href=#><strong>Famous Celebrities Born On November 20</strong></a></p><h3><span><strong>This Day That Year – </strong></span><span><strong>November 20&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>In History</strong></span></h3><p><strong>1977</strong> – Walter Payton runs 275 yards for the Bears.<br><strong>1984</strong> – The McDonald’s food chain sells its 50 billionth hamburger.<br><strong>1994</strong> – Paul Hayeland and Patti Davis get married.<br><strong>2009</strong> – Troubles over fishing rights; over 50,000 jobs lost.</p><p><span><strong>November 20</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>&nbsp;<a href=#>Vrishchika Rashi</a> <span>(Vedic Moon Sign)<br></span><span><strong>November 20</strong></span>&nbsp;<a href=#>Chinese Zodiac PIG</a></p><h3><strong><span>Birthday Planet</span></strong></h3><p><b></b><span>Your ruling planet is</span><strong>&nbsp;<span><strong><a href=#>Mars</a></strong></span> </strong><span>which symbolizes your take on life and how you <a href=#>face obstacles</a> with confidence.</span></p><h3><span><b>November 20 Birthday Symbols</b></span></h3><p><strong>The <a href=#>Scorpion</a></strong> Is The Symbol For The Scorpio Sun Sign</p><h3><span><b>November 20 Birthday Tarot Card</b></span></h3><p><b></b>Your Birthday Tarot Card is <strong>Judgment</strong>.
