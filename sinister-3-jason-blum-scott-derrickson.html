Why, you ask? A good question that Screen Geek&nbsp;attempts to answer in its latest report, beginning with this quote from Scott Derrickson (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor Strange</a>) from 2016:</p><p>Sure, yeah, I’d like there to be ten of them, but it really depends on how this turns out and how it does. The reason the script took so long was because both [co-screenwriter C.Robert] Cargill and I have seen so many horror franchises – you know, we’re really familiar with how they tend to work and what the bad tendencies are. And so we were both really committed to writing the kind of horror sequel we would like to see, and that proved to be a lot more difficult than I think either of us were expecting.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sinister-3.jpg alt width=650 height=406 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Blum, meanwhile, has been quoted as saying that&nbsp;the decision to retire Sinister – for now, at least – can be attributed to money, as the widely derided Sinister 2 failed to light up the box office in the way Blumhouse Productions would have hoped:</p><p>There is no ‘Sinister 3.’ We didn’t do well enough with ‘Sinister 2.’ Not enough people went to see ‘Sinister 2’ to make ‘Sinister 3,’ which is really sad. One of things that I get asked a lot is: ‘What are your professional regrets?’ Obviously, I have a lot of regrets professionally. Every movie we make, some of them are great, some of them are less great, of course. Sometimes the movies work because of the movies, sometimes it’s the marketing; it’s a complicated thing.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false><strong>Sinister 3</strong> is a pipe dream, then, so perhaps Blumhouse will choose to splice its DNA with that of Insidious in order to create Hollywood’s most horrifying crossover? We live in hope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqKmmajBpr6MbGSjmaOku26uy66kZquTpMG1ecOeqauhk6DAsLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./momona-tamada-4.html><span>←</span><span>Momona Tamada Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</span></a>
