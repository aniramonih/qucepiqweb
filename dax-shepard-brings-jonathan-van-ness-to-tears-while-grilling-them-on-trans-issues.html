Then there’s another counterargument. If they kill themselves, then that’s really f–king permanent. … To even question it makes you an enemy. I don’t think that’s the way forward.”</p><p>“I feel like I’m talking to my dad,” Van Ness shot back.</p><p>The hairstylist proceeded to shift the conversation to transgender athletes and how they don’t really have the competitive advantages as some people like to think they do.</p><p>“There’s just so many things that are so much more important and we’re over here being like, ‘Well, there’s legitimate concerns [about transgender athletes],’” Van Ness said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shepard grilled Van Ness on the subject of trans gender people and trans kids in sports. <span class=credit>Dax Shepard/Instagram</span></figure><p>“All I’m saying is what we know about misinformation and disinformation is when you have an outsized reaction to something, there’s a good chance that you’re being exposed to misinformation and disinformation. And a lot of the rhetoric around the anti-trans backlash does have a lot of misinformation and disinformation in it.”</p><p>Van Ness added that he finds it “disappointing” to realize how many people “think they’re really fighting” for women when they exclude trans kids from sports.</p><p>“I’m a nonbinary f–king trans person. When I talk to my dad or people who say similar things, it’s hard to be cool through that,” he said, later telling Shepard and his co-host Monica Padman, “I’m not calling you a transphobe. You can not be transphobic and still have thoughts that espouse trans misogyny and espouse transphobic ideologies or beliefs and not be transphobic.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Van Ness is non-binary and uses they/he/she pronouns. <span class=credit>Instagram/jvn</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shepard attends the SuperMotocross World Championship Finals Celebrity Night at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Sept. 23. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Feld Entertainment</span></figure><p>Van Ness continued, becoming more emotional, “I just get a lot of little kids who aren’t allowed to, like, join groups,” he said about their LGBTQ+ advocacy work.</p><p>“I was really bullied for my gender expression as a little kid. And there’s a lot of little kids who aren’t going to go be Olympic gold medalist. They don’t want to f–king go to the Olympics. They’re not gonna play —90 to 99% of kids who want to play sports aren’t trying to go to the Olympics, right?”</p><p>“Honestly, I just — I wanted to come, like, chat about my podcast…” Van Ness attempted to round up the intensifying conversation.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Van Ness claimed he was not upset at Shepard for launching the debate. <span class=credit>Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows</span></figure><p>“We’re gonna do that, we’re gonna do that,” Shephard promised.</p><p>“I did not intend at all to get into a debate with you about this,” he added, again complementing Van Ness. “I didn’t want that at all. I adore you. I think you’re hysterical and talented and I love that you’re an activist.”</p><p>“I could just cry because I’m so tired of having to&nbsp;fight for little kids&nbsp;because they just want to be included,” Van Ness told Shepard through tears. “I wish that people were as passionate about little kids being able to be included or grow up as they were about fictitious women’s fairness in sports. I have to tell you I am very tired.”</p><p>Van Ness added, “I’m scared of the vitriol that trans people face everyday.”</p><p>Shepard and Padman then apologized to Van Ness and stressed they did not intend to upset the TV personality.</p><p>Van Ness claimed he was not upset, but muttered, “It is what it is.” <strong><br></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma21fma65edKhnKmZopl6o77Ip56sZZqku6LAx5qlZq6Ro3qvsdKsZK2nXamyor7SZq6hoZyaeqi%2ByKWjoqaXYsGpscxmpqdlpKeur7%2BMoqqsrZWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-justice-net-worth-259027.html><span>←</span><span>David Justice Net Worth 2024</span></a>
