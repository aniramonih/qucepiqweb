Colon allegedly stole the truck when he could not find the keys to his own vehicle when he had to drive back home from the bar after a night of drinking.</p><p>Colon’s motive for stealing the Chevrolet pickup truck was so surprising that the Port St Lucie Police Department made a post about it in the early hours of July 28. The post, that soon went viral, had the title, “Man Arrested for Stealing Truck from Bar Parking Lot Because He Needed a Ride Home.”</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>What did William Colon do?</h2><p>Colon went to a bar in the 900 Block of Southwest Gatlin Blvd. The night soon turned wild and after a couple of drinks, Colon realized he had to go home. However, a slight problem hindered his exit plans as he did not have a ride home. Apparently, he was also not in the mood to call an Uber — which is what most bar patrons are advised to do when drunk.</p><p>While contemplating his next move, Colon found a set of keys that were on a table. Without wasting a moment, he went outside and realized the car keys he had stolen matched a Chevrolet pickup truck in the bar's parking lot. Colon then started the engine and drove off, heading back home.</p><p>The actual owner of the vehicle, a woman, was distressed when she found her truck gone and her keys missing and immediately called 911. The PSLPD responded at 10.30 pm. The police quickly located the Chevrolet truck and its driver traveling down US Route 1 and “pulled him over.”</p><p>When the police then asked the 31-year-old Florida man why he stole the vehicle, they received a novel reply. The Facebook post by the Port St Lucie PD stated that Colon “informed Officers he stole the vehicle because he did not have a ride home and did not want to call an Uber.” Colon was arrested and charged with a “grand theft of a motor vehicle.” Colon was also not carrying a valid driving license when he was caught driving the stolen vehicle.</p><h2 class=split>'Hope he can get a ride to the courthouse!'</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Netizens became really creative in the comment section of the Facebook post as they found it hilarious that the Florida man chose to steal a truck as he wanted a ride home. One person thought he looked like the Canadian musician, The Weeknd, as they said, "Dang is that The Weeknd?" Some netizens sounded flabbergasted that Colon was apparently sober enough to drive and respond to cops when he got pulled over. "And he was sober through all of this??" with a slew of laughing emojis. "Hope he can get a ride to the courthouse!" said another while someone else quipped, "I bet he enjoyed the real ride he got after committing that stupid act."</p><p>A Facebook user said pragmatically, "I’m sure his family is very proud of his (sic) next time just stay home it’s cheaper," while another followed, "He’s gonna be on a bus to prison shortly." One Florida resident chimed in, "Only in the great State of Florida."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonpykv6qwwGakmqZdlr%2BzsdKtnJ1llqS%2Fbr%2FTnpiloZ6cerW%2B1JyiZpqVmK62v8Rmn55lp5bAbrXNZqWenZRivKd5wGapopyVYrWwucRmpqdlmqq5unmRcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dominic-raiola-son-dylan.html><span>←</span><span>Dominic Raiola Son, Dylan: Following His Fathers Footsteps</span></a>
