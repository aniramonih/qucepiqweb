<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>UFC: Logan Paul confirms he offered to pay for lookalike's lawyers in Nate Diaz's lawsuit</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=ue-c-article--first-letter-highlighted><span class=capital-letter>L</span>ess than a month ago, former <strong>UFC </strong>star <strong>Nate Diaz</strong> got into some serious legal trouble after choking out a <strong><a href=#>Logan Paul lookalike</a></strong>. His name is<strong> Rodney Petersen</strong>, who is <strong>@not_logan_paul</strong> on Instagram due to his striking resemblance to the Youtuber. The two of them are actually good friends and they have worked together in some videos to promote PRIME Evergy Drinks. As a first reaction to Nate Diaz's violent actions, Logan Paul initially released a comedy bit alongside brother <strong>Jake Paul.</strong> Those two are fighting each other on <strong><a href=#>August 5</a></strong> but these legal issues might prevent the fight from taking place. Logan just made a revelation about Rodney Petersen's intentions to sue Diaz.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1.5><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Nate Diaz appears to choke out a Youtube celebrity on the streets of New Orleans:Is that Logan Paul?</span></p></figure><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Logan Paul gets involved in the Nate Diaz lawsuit</h2><p>Given that <strong>Logan Paul</strong> feels slightly responsible for what happened to Rodney, he revealed the following about the lawsuit: "I connected him (Rodney) with some legal council and I think he's walk away from a pretty healthy check. I offered to fund the lawsuit against <strong>Nate Diaz</strong> but the legal team took the case pro bono because I would assume they think it's a take away. There isn't any much to say really. A professional MMA fighter choked out a civilian with relatively no combat experience. You know why it's annoying? I'll say it because I was supposed to fight Nate. Then he goes to fight my little brother instead and then chokes out my lookalike in the street. It's so weird, he is a bully."</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Jake Paul and Logan Paul mock Nate Diaz with a hilarious 'self-defense' how-to video</span></p></figure><p>This might also mean that <strong>Logan Paul</strong> feels angry because of how absurd the situation truly is and he wanted to do something about it. Paul also goes on to talk about<strong> Jake Paul's</strong> fight and <strong>WWE's Summerslam</strong> are taking place on the same date. He still has no idea if he is fighting on that event but he knows it would be massive for both Paul brothers if they fought on the same day. However, the biggest take away here is that Logan Paul actually offered to pay for <strong>Rodney Petersen's</strong> legal fees after the incident. It has always been normal for pro combat sport athletes to get in legal trouble if they use their skills against a normal civilian outside of their competitive setting. They are considered lethal weapons and should be treated as such.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jq6dnGdiZX90e49uZmlxX2uBdq3Am2lxnWJsfXWxl2ppb3CSaYKlso2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-gustin.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler Gustin: The Photographer Brother of The Flash Star</span></a>
