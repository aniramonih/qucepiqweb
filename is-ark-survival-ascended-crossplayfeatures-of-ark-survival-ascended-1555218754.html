However, there's a temporary hold on crossplay between PC and consoles, mainly due to a delay in the console release. Once the game is available on consoles, crossplay will be activated.</p><p>Moreover, the game offers cross-platform progression, a feature that lets players seamlessly transfer their items and progress across different gaming platforms.

Many players appreciate this feature as it enables them to continue their in-game adventures without starting from scratch when changing platforms.</p><p>Additionally, ARK: Survival Ascended introduces cross-platform modding, thanks to Overwolf. While PC players have traditionally enjoyed modding for an enhanced gaming experience, console players were limited to the base game and DLCs. With the arrival of ARK: Survival Ascended, console players can now access and enjoy mods created by PC players, unlocking a new realm of possibilities and customization for players across all platforms.</p><h2>Ark: Survival Ascended</h2><p>Ark: Survival Ascended is an action-adventure survival video game created by Studio Wildcard. Released initially on Windows in October 2023, with later releases planned for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, it serves as a revamped version of the 2015 game Ark: Survival Evolved.</p><p>Set in a prehistoric world filled with dinosaurs and other creatures, players must survive, tame wildlife, build shelters, and cooperate or compete with other players.
