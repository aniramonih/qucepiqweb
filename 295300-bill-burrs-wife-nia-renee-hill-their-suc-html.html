<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Bill Burrs Wife Nia Renee Hill &amp;amp; Their Successful Relationship</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class="dh fh">Bill Burr holds many titles in the house of entertainment, all of which he bears successfully. He is a stand-up comedian, an actor, a writer, and a podcaster. However, the creative also holds the title of a family man as a loving husband to his wife, Nia Renee Hill, and father to two children.</p><p class=dh>Bill Burr is also known for his frequent references to his wife during his stand-up performances. In his routines, the comedian acknowledges the controversy of marrying a black woman as a white man. Although the couple keeps their relationship relatively private, it has been subject to scrutiny from the public, such as last year in March on Twitter.</p><p class=dh>Nia Renee Hill defended her husband when he was accused of being a racist because he married a black woman. The Twitter users in question suggested that their relationship was "a sign of racism" and that Hill was Burr's "minority sex servant." Regardless of these opinions, the couple seems to enjoy married life and parenthood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1c04d293826d1814c78b814e3c52cb01.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Burr and Nia Renee Hill pose on the red carpet at the Los Angeles Premiere Of Netflix's New Film "Blonde" on September 13, 2022, in Hollywood | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Nia Renee Hill</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In the comedy horror series, Hill plays the role of a wife looking to buy a home with her husband. Her real-life husband, Bill Burr, hosts a podcast called "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.youtube.com/c/BillBurrOfficial>Monday Morning Podcast</a>," where she also appears frequently. The actress is also a mother-of-two who welcomed her first baby, Lola, with Burr in January 2017.</p><p class=dh>In a since-deleted Instagram post, Hill <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/who-bill-burr-s-wife-meet-nia-renee-hill-t193979>announced the expectancy</a> of her secondborn in May 2020. Per <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/who-bill-burr-s-wife-meet-nia-renee-hill-t193979>Today</a>, she disclosed the arrival of her baby in June 2020 via another deleted Instagram post, where she shared a snap of herself cradling her newborn son.</p><p class=dh>However, the exact details of when Hill's son was born are unknown, and neither she nor her husband has revealed his name. During his interview on "The Jimmy Kimmel Show," Burr happily opened up about the expansion of his family. Per Today, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/who-bill-burr-s-wife-meet-nia-renee-hill-t193979>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"She gave me a beautiful baby boy, so I got a daughter and a son now, and it's awesome."</p><p class=dh>The comedian remarked that his son was "emotionally wired" like his wife, describing their nature as "totally chill." Burr explained that caring for his son wasn't much of a hassle as the infant only cried if he was hungry.</p><p class=dh>Burr has never been afraid of touching on sensitive topics during his stand-up shows. During his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/PGuqnE35cCg>Netflix special</a>, he reveals that he had been with his wife for fifteen years and notes that he's learned how interracial relationships are no different from relationships in which partners come from the same race groups.</p><p class=dh>Hence, the actor saw no purpose in the existence of comparison jokes that chronicle how white men are different from black men in relationships with black women. Per <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.today.com/popculture/who-bill-burr-s-wife-meet-nia-renee-hill-t193979>Today</a>, Burr also expressed his disdain when he heard them, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/PGuqnE35cCg>saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I hate those jokes, you know, 'cause they're easy, and it's been my experience that it's just not true. Fifteen years of being with her, there is really no difference [...]."</p><p class=dh>Hill has also shared her thoughts on interracial marriage. In 2013, the actress reportedly published an article sharing anecdotes on her dating life, which frequently included white men. She then offers advice on handling friendships with people who date interracially with kindness and open-mindedness.</p><p class=dh>Hill wrote another blog piece that year, explaining how it felt to have her husband be the only breadwinner in their relationship. She described herself as "lazy" while adding that she was afraid of failure and, ironically, success. However, the mother-of-two planned to become an equal contributor with her husband.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bill Burr and Nia Renee Hill's Relationship</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Bill Burr and Nia Renee Hill are speculated to have met <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://parade.com/1264900/shameikarhymes/bill-burr-wife-nia-renee-hill/>during their college</a> years when they were both enrolled in Emerson College in Boston. The couple fell in love and decided to move in together. Shortly after that, they moved to Los Angeles to pursue their shared passion for entertainment.</p><p class=dh>The couple married in September 2013. Burr - who touched on "white feminism" during his monologue on "Saturday Night Live" - once spoke about his skepticism regarding marriage. The actor was not yet lucky enough to meet the love of his life and remarked that he hadn't seen a man who was happy in his marriage, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://parade.com/1264900/shameikarhymes/bill-burr-wife-nia-renee-hill/>explaining</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I will get married the day I see a married guy who actually looks happy."</p><p class=dh>The details of their wedding day remain unknown, but the couple seems incredibly supportive of each other's work. Per <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPWM35XlDM4">Parade</a>, Hill frequently celebrates her husband's achievements on social media. The actress created a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.youtube.com/user/bbstopit>YouTube channel</a> where she mainly posts the highlights of her husband's performances.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Couple Works Together</strong></h2></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Bill Burr</a> and Nia Renee Hill, who appears alongside Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant in "Santa Clarita Diet," are known to collaborate on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/259351/the-untold-truth-of-bill-burrs-wife/>entertainment projects together</a>. Apart from being on her husband's "Monday Morning Podcast," Hill is also one of the voice actors in her husband's show "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4326894/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">F is for Family</a>" on Netflix.</p><p class=dh>Hill lends her voice to the character Georgia Roosevelt in the adult animated series. According to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/259351/the-untold-truth-of-bill-burrs-wife/>Nicki Swift</a>, Hill, whose husband was listed as one of the highest-paid comedians in America, indicated that she was the Creative Director of Tenderhead Films since 2012. However, it is unknown if she still holds that position today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbmtgZXqjtculZJutoqfAbsPIn5xmppmWerOxzZ6cZqCZobluwMeeoKtlo6qwb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./northern-ireland.html><span>←</span><span>Best hotels in Newcastle, Northern Ireland</span></a>
