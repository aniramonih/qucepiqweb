<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>Mike Conley Just Signed The Largest Contract In NBA History</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Selected 4th in the 2007 NBA Draft, Mike Conley has been a member of the Memphis Grizzlies for his entire career. He's had a productive nine seasons, making NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 2013 and helping lead the Grizzlies to the playoffs every year since 2011. While he's certainly a solid player, he's never made an All-Star team, and just about every "Top 5 Point Guards" list would exclude him.</p><p>But for now, Conley has one thing no other player in the league does: the richest contract in NBA history.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Grizzlies re-signed Conley to a </span><b>five-year, $153 million </b><span style=font-weight:400>deal to keep him in Memphis, which is a higher dollar amount in total value than any other player has ever received. It's also the first contract in NBA history to be over $100 million in total value with an annual salary average of at least $30 million.</span></p><p>If <a href=# title="Kevin Durant Net Worth">Kevin Durant</a> returns to the Oklahoma City this offseason on a five-year deal, he can match what Conley just got, but this record will likely hold until the following offseason, when the salary cap balloons once again.</p><p>Only two players prior to Conley have made $30 million in a season: <a href=# title="Kobe Bryant Net Worth">Kobe Bryant</a> and <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>. Between them, they have 11 NBA championships, six MVPs, eight Finals MVPs, and 12 scoring titles. Aside from the one All-Defensive Second Team appearance, Conley's only other professional accolades are winning the NBA Sportsmanship Award twice, in 2014 and again this past season.</p><p>However, these enormous contracts will soon become the standard in the NBA. The salary cap rose from $70 million to $94 million in just one year, and it's set to increase to somewhere around $107 million. Then again, at this time last year, the projections were that the salary cap would rise to somewhere in the $87-$89 million range. What actually happened blew that out of the water, so we could very likely see the same thing happen next offseason.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-199855 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/conley2.jpg alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-199855 class=wp-caption-text>Andy Lyons/Getty Images</p><p>Players earn a percentage of the salary cap, with the max fluctuating based on tenure in the league. Conley, who has played nine seasons, signed a deal worth 30 percent of the cap, with 7.5 percent annual raises.</p><p>By comparison, <a href=# title="Chandler Parsons Net Worth">Chandler Parsons</a>, whom Conley heavily helped recruit to the Grizzlies, just signed his own max deal, inking a four-year, $94 million contract. Alongside <a href=# title="Marc Gasol Net Worth">Marc Gasol</a>, who signed a five-year, $110 million deal last offseason, the Grizzlies have a talented, if oft-injured core.</p><p>The trio of Conley, Gasol and Randolph have led a Memphis team that has always been a pesky out in the playoffs, defeating the Spurs as an 8-seed in 2011, knocking off the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder en route to the Western Conference Finals in 2013, and giving the eventual champion Golden State Warriors fits in a tough six-game series in 2015.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Will an extremely well-paid Conley and Parsons be enough to get the Grizzlies over the hump in the loaded Western Conference? That remains to be seen, but Memphis snagging two highly-sought free agents – even if one of them was already a member of their team – is a huge win for a small market.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqagpJ1dmLyvuMSyZKOto6l6tLXGp5ydZaSdsm64wKuenqukYrCwutOrmJysXZ67brrBmmShoaOpvLPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-nesmith.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Nesmith Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
