The 36-year-old Shiver is charged with planning the botched murder-for-hire plot, in which Bethel and 29-year-old Faron Newbold were also involved.</p><p>Bahamas Court News claims that when looking into a possible burglar, police discovered this evil scheme, which ultimately led them to Lindsay Shiver’s phone and social media account. According to reports, the hitman’s intended victim was former Auburn University football player Robert Shiver.</p><p>Additionally, authorities believe she might have paid for her husband’s death. After being captured on Abaco, Lindsay Shiver was taken to Nassau along with the two male suspects, where they appeared in court to answer to charges. In response to the accusations made against them, none of the accused have entered a plea.</p><p>The neighborhood has been rocked by the horrific extent of this purported plot, leaving many in shock.

Robert was born and raised in Thomasville, Georgia, and had strong ties to the area. He was born Robert Shirley and played football at Auburn University, where he excelled as a deep snapper and followed his vocation. With his 6 feet 3 inch height and 222 pounds of muscle, Robert’s physical strength won him the admiration of his coaches and teammates.</p><p>Robert Shiver was renowned for his pleasant disposition and kind attitude in addition to his sporting accomplishments. He met Auburn cheerleader Lindsay Shiver by happenstance while he was a student there. A unique bond formed between the two, and that friendship developed into a love relationship.</p><p>Robert’s life was tragically cut short, and his sudden death saddened his friends, family, and the Auburn community. There is no doubt that the loss of this youthful and gifted person leaves a hole in the hearts of all who knew him.
