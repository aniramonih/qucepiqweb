That show highlighted Simpson’s ignorance of other customs, although that may have been inevitable considering whom we’re talking about. It sounds like Rachel’s show, which originally aired in her native New Zealand, takes a more pragmatic view. She said in a press conference that she has felt pressure to get plastic surgery and that people have said rude things about her aging:</p><p>Rachel Hunter confesses she has considered plastic surgery after feeling “horrified” seeing photos of herself. The 46-year-old former Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover model took to wearing scarves to hide her jowls.</p><p>“In real life I was fairly happy with myself. In photos I was horrified,” she said Tuesday from the Television Critics Association winter meeting. “People were like, ‘Why don’t you get rid of those deep lines (around her mouth)?’”</p><p>Hunter, who has two grown children with ex-husband Rod Stewart, changed her opinion once she began working on her new Ovation series “Rachel Hunter’s Tour of Beauty.” The 13-episode show debuting Jan. 17 takes viewers around the globe to discover indigenous beauty secrets and how beauty is defined in different cultures.</p><p>“I was very much considering plastic surgery, and then I had an amazing opportunity to go on this journey which really changed my view on the whole idea of it. That moment of beauty when a woman actually feels beautiful— it’s the synchronicity between internal and external that have to have this amazing harmony moment.”</p><p>“When I first started modeling, the idea of what beauty was– that certain look… After going on this journey and seeing other cultures away went that superficial idea of beauty… I think the ideas of beauty are old and need to be shattered and there is individuality and the importance of being joyful and happy and connected and self-acceptance is extremely important of the wellbeing of women and men.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six</a> <a href=#>and Fox News]</a></p><p>She looks damn good at 46 and she would only look like everyone else if she had plastic surgery. I used to hate those lines around my mouth too, the nasolabial folds, and they looked so pronounced when I first lost weight. I’ve since gained about 3-5 pounds back, it varies, and they’re not as noticeable. (Either that or I got used to them.) It’s really true what they say about getting older – your ass or your face. When you take a shortcut like injectables or surgery it makes you somehow look older for trying to cheat. There are those rare treatments like lasers and electromagnetic current (ok, <a rel=nofollow href=#>I own this</a> and use it) that give results which look natural, but it’s really hard to tell if we’re just paying for snake oil ultimately. Maybe Jessica Simpson’s series had a more accurate title.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/FFN_Hunter_Rachel_FOR_080715_51818396_edited-1-687x1024.jpg alt="Rachel Hunter Out Grocery Shopping At Bristol Farms" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wenn22387743_edited-1.jpg alt="MIPTV 2015" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wenn22385016_edited-1-682x1024.jpg alt="MIPTV 2015 Opening Party" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>photo credit: WENN.com and FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW5kZoJ0e9GamqGdnJS1trrTnqmYp56Urqi1zaCWopenlsCgtM6rqaKemZqxoK3NnZacp56otqWx0Z6bmKiclsC1tcKYqq6ql5q%2Funs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quite-the-catch-inside-cal-ripken-jrs-12-5-million-home.html><span>←</span><span>Quite the &amp;quot;Catch:&amp;quot; Inside Cal Ripken Jr.'s $12.5 Million Home</span></a>
