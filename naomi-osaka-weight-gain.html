The 5 feet 11 inches tall tennis player has gained a significant amount of weight over the years. Fans online make hurtful comments about Naomi Osaka's looks calling her a fat tennis player and that her body looks like the body of a pregnant woman.</strong></p><p>Japanese <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>tennis player</a></strong> <strong>Naomi Osaka</strong> has won four Grand Slam singles championships to date—two at the US Open and two at the Australian Open. She won her first Grand Slam after defeating her hero <strong>Serena Williams</strong> in the US Open finals in 2018 and became the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam singles championship.</p><p>She was born on October 16, 1997, to <strong>Tamaki Osaka</strong> and <strong>Leonard François</strong> in Ch-ku, Osaka, Japan. Her father is from Jacmel, Haiti, while her mother is from Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan. She has an elder sister named <strong>Mari</strong> who used to play tennis professionally.</p><p>When the family lived in Japan, the two girls were given their mother's family name for practicality. When Osaka's father visited Hokkaido while he was a college student in New York, that is how her parents first got to know each other. She was born in Japan and raised in America.</p><p>She has been recognized by Forbes for two years in a row as the female athlete with the highest lifetime earnings. She was selected as one of the 2020 Sports Illustrated Sportspersons of the Year and has twice appeared on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people. She is well known for her activism and support for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>There have been rumors online recently claiming that the athlete has gained weight in recent times. Read this article to know all about her weight gain journey.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Swift</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Alexis Ohanian</a></strong>.</p><h2>Fans Online Claim That Naomi Osaka’s Weight Gain Has Impacted Her Performance!</h2><p><strong>Naomi Osaka</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@naomiosaka</a>) was depressed during the 2018 US Open, which was a major <a href=# rel=noopener>contributing factor</a> to her weight gain. She was fined <strong>$15,000</strong> in May 2021 when the news of her refusal to take part in mandated press conferences during the French Open broke. It not only put a halt to her future tennis career but also brought negative attention to her and stoked rumors about her weight gain.</p><p>On May 31, 2021, she decided to withdraw from the event in order to take care of her mental health. Less than a month later, she withdrew from Wimbledon once more, claiming that she needed to spend some private time with her family and friends. She threw her racket three times and was given a code violation for throwing a ball toward the audience when she lost against <strong>Leylah Fernandez</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@leylahannietennis</a>) due to depression.</p><p>At the 2022 Indian Wells Open, Osaka had to go to counseling because she was in tears. She said that the procedure had helped her health. She is now equipped to handle a similar incident in the future.</p><p>Concerns regarding the 5 foot 11 inches tall Naomi Osaka's notable weight gain and the media's seeming lack of attention to it in the days after the match have been widely expressed. They commented that it was exceedingly unusual for a professional athlete to do so at the age of 24, and they speculated as to whether there might be an underlying medical issue. Fans online claim that she appears fat for a tennis player.</p><p>When Naomi Osaka was at her lowest point, some people tried to defend her from this kind of unfavorable attention by claiming that they were overanalyzing the comments about weight gain and that people's weight fluctuates more frequently than we realize, so they don't always look the same and that it might have also been the outfit.</p><p>These followers held the belief that everyone has a negative side, and that is exactly how it was. She never had a really slim build, but she also hasn't gained any notable weight. The same view is shared by other demographic groups regarding Naomi Osaka's weight growth. They observed that Osaka had been steadily gaining weight for years, even though she is not obese but her fitness has definitely taken a hit.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Some people claim that she is too heavy for an elite athlete competing in a sport that requires both quickness and stamina at least not in relation to the general population. She should also be able to get better considering the resources at her disposal. Supporters of Naomi Osaka backed her when it was suggested that she get in better shape, stating that her weight has never prevented her from competing. They further stated that such claims are egregiously insulting and hurtful.</p><p>Although she spoke about suffering from depression, Naomi Osaka never explicitly stated whether her weight gain was a result of her depression. She admitted that she had suffered extended spells of mental illness ever since she defeated <strong>Serena Williams</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@serenawilliams</a>) at the US Open in 2018.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGilmqednnqwv8CkmGavlZ60qcCMoJiipl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-rich-is-milo-yiannopoulos-wiki-net-worth-husband-john-lewis-dating.html><span>←</span><span>How rich is Milo Yiannopoulos?
