Confirming her marital status, she disclosed in a 2017 interview with Women of Influence that she is happily married to a supportive partner who plays a crucial role in her life and career.</p><p>“I consider myself very lucky to have a spouse that is both understanding and supportive of my job. When I go overseas for a month or work 12-hour shifts that finish at 3 a.m. and require a ride home, my hubby is always there for me and cheering me on from the sidelines. It’s critical to have a strong support system.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/KJ-Wright-4.jpg alt="kj wright" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>KJ and her spouse share a respectful and amicable relationship, allowing her to navigate the demanding NBA reporting role, which often involves covering over 80 games in 25 weeks, with the unwavering support of her husband.</p><p>Respecting her husband’s privacy, she refrains from sharing details or images of him publicly.
