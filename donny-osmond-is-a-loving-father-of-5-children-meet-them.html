Donny Osmond had all his five sons with the only love of his life, his wife, Debra Osmond</strong>.</p><p>The Osmond boys are all grown up and forging their own part in life, and many of them opted to follow professions outside the entertainment industry. While Donald works as a public relations officer, Jeremy is an expert in physical therapy, and Brandon is an art director, though he dabbles into acting and music occasionally. The only son of the entertainer that seems to be following in his footsteps is Christopher, who is already creating a niche for himself in the music world. Joshua, the last child of Donny and Debra, is into missionary work.</p><h2><strong>Meet Donny Osmond’s Children</strong></h2><h2><strong>Donald Clark Osmond Jr.</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 31, 1979</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 44 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Debra Osmond</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Public relations officer</li></ul><p>Donny Osmond has five biological children, and the first one is Donald Osmond Clark Jr., Born on the 31st of July 1979. The American actor and his lifelong wife, Debra Osmond, became first-time parents when they welcomed Donald in Salt Lake Temple, Utah, in the United State. The celebrity kid’s place of birth is an indication of his American nationality, but his ethnic background is Caucasian.</p><p>Donald has not revealed anything about his academic journey, but he is said to have attended elementary and high school in his locality. He also went all the way to college, but the name of his academic institution and course of study has never been revealed.</p><h3><b>Donald Clark Osmond Jr is a PR Guru</b></h3><p>Donald Clark Osmond Jr. is quite unlike his entertainment icon father as he chooses to follow a completely different career path. According to Donny Osmond’s first son, he was sick and tired of the kind of fame and popularity that followed his dad and uncle, as it brought him a lot of bad experiences. “It ate me up”, Donald said. Thus, when the time came for him to choose a career path, he went to pitch his tent in the public relations field, becoming “the spin doctor of all spin.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/Donny-Osmond-Jr.jpg><p>The Spectrum revealed that Donny Osmond’s oldest son owns and runs his own public relations firm in the US. He is also connected to OzComm Marketing as a managing partner thanks to his experience in business marketing. Donald has his father on his client list.</p><p>The media PR officer may have rejected everything about fame, but that has not stopped him from making brief onscreen appearances from time to time. In 2012, he appeared in a preview clip on The Talk alongside his movie icon dad. According to the father-son duo, their intention was to spin a surprise on the very special ladies of the program for Father’s Day.</p><h3><strong>He is Happily Married to Jessica Nelson</strong></h3><p>Donald Clark Osmond Jr. has been married for over one decade. His better half has been identified as Jessica Nelson, and they exchanged wedding vows in Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple, South Jordan, in 2010.</p><p>From what is perceivable, Donald’s marriage is beginning to look like the “happily ever after kind of union, just like what his parents enjoy. What’s more, he and Jessica are already parents to four lovely kids. They welcomed their last child in 2020, making it the 12th grandchild for Donny Osmond, who couldn’t contain his joy.

Jeremy is just a couple of years younger than his big brother, Donald Jr. An American national, he was also born in Utah, and his ethnicity is equally Caucasian. Donny had Jeremy from his marriage with Debra.</p><p>Though he is the type that loves to live their life away from public scrutiny, it has come to the fore that Jeremy is well educated. He started his academic journey in Utah and went on to acquire a Ph.D. in physical therapy.</p><h3><strong>Jeremy Osmond Works as a Physical Therapist</strong></h3><p>Jeremy is another of Donny Osmond’s children that declined to follow him into the entertainment industry.

Jeremy and Melisa are parents to two boys and one girl – Dylan James in 2005, Ryder James, who came in 2013, and daughter Emery (b. 2008).</p><p>Donny Osmond once took to his Instagram to gush about his cute granddaughter, describing her as his sweet princess; Donny said Emery is radiant on the inside and outside and growing up very fast. He also commended her for growing into a strong woman which gives him an immense sense of pride “Bapa loves you, Emy”, he ended the post.</p><h2><strong>Brandon Michael Osmond</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 29th January 1985</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 38 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Debra Osmond</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Musician, actor, photographer, art designer, and advertiser</li></ul><p>Born on the 29th of January 1985, Brandon Michael Osmond is the third child of Donny Osmond and his wife, Debra Osmond.

Brandon started working in the company in 2020 and is still with them.</p><p>A veritable jack of all trades, Brandon dabbles in acting, music, photography, and everything that is connected to creativity.

Chris holds a very special place in his dad’s heart, as the duo’s birthdays are just days apart. Thus, they often celebrate together. The fact that he is almost a birthday mate with his son seems to be a big hit with the entertainment heavyweight. He took to Instagram in December 2020 to gush about how much he loves celebrating with Chris, “You are the best birthday gift I’ve ever received,” Donny concluded.</p><p>Like his siblings, Chris was also born in Utah and is an American citizen.

Because of the ravaging effects of the pandemic in America, the duo was joined in a private ceremony in his dad’s backyard. The moment was described as simple yet very memorable for the newlyweds.</p><p>Donny, who never misses an opportunity to gush over his children and their achievements, wasted no time in sharing their wedding picture via his IG handle and wrote, “Today was a picture-perfect day.
