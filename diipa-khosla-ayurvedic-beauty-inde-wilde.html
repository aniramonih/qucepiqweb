And it's already making strides in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skincare</a> arena with its unique, first-of-its-kind Ayurvedistry technology, stemming from the traditional <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Indian</a> practice of Ayurveda, which can be described as "the science of everything," according to the brand's third generation Ayurvedic practitioner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Nidhi Pandya</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's warfare, skincare, and healthcare," explains Pandya. "Ayurveda is the protection of the human body, mind, and soul — literally all of them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diipa was heavily influenced by her mother Dr. Sanghita Khosla growing up, who is a dermatologist and Ayurvedic doctor and now also sits on the brand's expert board. From her upbringing and passions of both Ayurveda and skincare, Diipa developed the concept of Ayurvedistry — the combination of Ayurvedic studies and chemistry — to create the world's first ever Ayurvedistry beauty brand, which will carry quality products made from superfoods used in Ayurveda that are catered towards those with brown skin, but is still safe for all skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"How you can take those 5,000-year-old principles, [and put them] in the modern times? It's about everything that's cutting edge, the innovations of today and the best of the Ayurvedic ingredients," Diipa explains during a Zoom interview. "Combine those super foods that we all know and love with the principles of Ayurveda. I like to call it the modern, empowered woman in a bottle."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Inde Wilde</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of her own skincare journey, Diipa tells us she suffered from acne for years and struggled to find effective products that were also safe for her skin type. "In that decade, it was me really learning about how to deal with [my acne], how to get the best from Ayurveda, the best from science, but also the best internal health," she says. "Your skin is your largest organ, and whatever's going on inside, comes out outside, too." So she decided to use her her own personal struggles as fuel to develop a brand to ensure all other young women of color have safe and effective skincare available.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Indē Wild is launching with two serums — one a.m. and one p.m. — meant to tackle numerous<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> skin concerns</a> with their plethora of natural and innovative ingredients, which includes superfoods used in the practice of Ayurveda. And both serums are formulated with sensitive and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>acne-prone skin</a> in mind so you don't have to worry about the products causing breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We always think [about] sensitive and acne-prone skin or skin barriers that are not working — all of those were like the benchmark," she explains. "We need to make sure [everyone] can use it, so the ingredients in the A.M. and P.M. are very mindful of that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the morning after you wash your face and before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SPF</a>, apply the A.M. Sunrise Glow serum, which contains vitamin C, vitamin E and ferulic acid, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, turmeric, and ashwaghanda to moisturize, brighten, soothe inflammation and redness, plus protect your skin throughout the day.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Inde Wilde</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>washing </a>the day off your face, the P.M. Sunset Restore serum will do just that as well. Containing bakuchiol (a plant-based <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>retinol</a> alternative), a tripeptide complex, squalane, amla, as well as saffron and rosehip seed oil, the serum will work to even out skin tone, smooth <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>fine lines</a>, repair damage, smooth texture, and promote collagen production.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Inde Wilde</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diipa adds that if you are someone who is susceptible to breakouts, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin C</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>niacinamide</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>turmeric</a>, and ashwaghanda can actually help treat your acne while the other ingredients cover other skin woes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not to mention, the serums were essentially designed to be the only serums you need in your arsenal, containing a number of different ingredients that target any and all skin concerns. So skip all the extra steps of mixing several serums together. You can cover all your bases with just these two <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>serums</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both of the serums are also completely safe for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pregnant</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>breastfeeding</a> moms to use as well, a caveat that many other skincare's most popular ingredients have. In fact, Diipa developed and used these products while she was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>pregnant</a> with her daughter Dua. And now the new mom set on sharing the safe yet effective skincare with other expectant and breastfeeding mothers.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Inde Wilde</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While a big goal of Diipa is to create skincare for everyone, regardless of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>race and ethnicity</a>, another pillar of the brand's mission is to educate the world on Ayurveda, as well as good skincare practices.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We want to be a brand that educates you on everything, on the preservatives and active ingredients," she explains. "Not just the one or two active ingredients that are great but then no one knows what else goes in there, and so we wanted to be a brand that was really transparent about everything and what goes into your body."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The A.M. and P.M. Serums ($37 per bottle) will be available in the U.S. and Canada starting October 12.
