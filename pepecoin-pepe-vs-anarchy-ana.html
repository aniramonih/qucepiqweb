<span>Tandra Barner</span></p><h1>Pepecoin (PEPE) vs Anarchy (ANA): The Pros and Cons of Investing in These Meme Coins</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;market is very popular, and different tokens lead the market at different times. Most bullish and negative flips are caused by meme coins since most meme coins rely on news and rumors on social media to drive up their prices.</p><p>This year, the Pepe coin came out, which is an example of a coin riding the wave of news. The launch started a trend that kept PEPE’s price stable for two months and left the rest of the market behind.</p><p>Not Anarchy (ANA), though! As far as the meme coin is concerned, the old meme ways are boring, and it’s setting a new trend for future starts. Top crypto analysts all agree that Anarchy (ANA) is worth a shot in 2023 because it has the potential to gain 100 times its value.</p><p>Here’s what you can get from the joke coin!</p><h2>Pepecoin (PEPE) is getting close to its end of life. Should I buy PEPE right now?</h2><p>Pepecoin’s price jump of 150,000% when it first came out is a great example of a great start in recent years.</p><p>Pepecoin (PEPE) pulled off a great trick by riding the popularity of Pepe the Frog around the world. This started a trend that made it the most popular cryptocurrency for over two months. The price of Pepe coin (PEPE) kept its users amused and making money while it led the cryptocurrency market every week until May when it hit its all-time high. Who said that meme coins can’t have fun?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-40.jpg><p>All of that progress seems to have stopped all at once because the token has been going down steadily since June. Pepe coin (PEPE) made a lot of people rich, but when red came up, everyone panicked and sold all of their Pepe coins.</p><p>Pepecoin (PEPE) was always going to fall when knockoff projects like Pepe 2.0 and Evil Pepe came out. After everything was said and done, Pepecoin brought an interesting trend to the cryptocurrency market by copying Shiba Inu’s run in 2021, but many analysts don’t think it’s a good bet right now.</p><p>Charts on Coinbase show that the price of Pepecoin (PEPE) is 60% less than its all-time high of $0.0000381. It was fun while it lasted, but the token will soon have to leave the spotlight. It’s time for Anarchy to shine, as its new protocol offers a longer meme coin trend that will keep going on its own.</p><h2>Anarchy (ANA): The Best Crypto To Invest In In 2023?</h2><p>Anarchy (ANA) is all about making new rules and trends, so it’s not surprising that the meme coin is getting off to a good start. The presale has been a huge success, bringing in $2 million in just six weeks. The main goal of the token is to bring down the corrupt government, and it will balance that with new trends to give people a good experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-27.jpg><p>But how will it fight against the government? Of course, with jokes. Anarchy (ANA) will try to change the systems that are already in place. They will use jokes and cartoons to point out corruption among strong policymakers and start a funny, sarcastic meme trend. On Anarchy (ANA), the DAO members will be involved in making memes, so you can laugh out loud while speaking out against the government.</p><p>One of Anarchy’s goals is to stay important for as long as possible. It plans to do this by lowering the number of tokens available over time. The platform for the token has built-in ways to burn 0.5% of every buy-and-sell exchange on the network.</p><p>Here’s the catch: Anarchy is having a presale right now, which means that you can buy ANA at a big discount. You can get your coins for $0.000024 if you go to the presale page here. That’s the quickest way to make sure you make money for the whole year since the 100x profit boost won’t last much longer. Don’t let this big chance pass you by!</p><p>Check More:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>How to Invest in the Top 7 Crypto Currencies for Long-Term Growth?</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Top 12 Most Popular Types of Cryptocurrency You Need to Know in 2023</a></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The cryptocurrency market is dominated by meme coins, such as Pepe coin, which has experienced a 150,000% price jump.
