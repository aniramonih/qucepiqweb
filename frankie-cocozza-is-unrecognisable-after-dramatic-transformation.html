While he burst onto our screens in rock and roll-inspired outfits with black leather, skinny jeans and T-shirts, nowadays Frankie seems to be favouring button-up long sleeved shirts with chinos and loafers, for a more relaxed style.</p><p id=eRRAGfNcLL1T data-wc=38>Despite being <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>famously axed from The X Factor in 2011</a>&nbsp;</strong>because of his off-stage antics, Frankie hasn't given up on a career in music. Following the show he formed rock band The Telescreen, performing a series of gigs and releasing single in December last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/371ecdac4a3d-frankie2-a.jpg><p class=text-center id=eL53b3Mc32S8 data-wc=6><strong>He has ditched his iconic hairstyle</strong></p><p id=evWufL0WWyTF data-wc=29>He has kept a relatively low profile in recent months, although he has shared a series of snaps on Instagram as he spent quality time with friends and family.</p><p id=eab56eQfJ8dx data-wc=21>There's no doubt that he has a loyal social media following, with over one million on Twitter and 141,000 on Instagram.</p><p id=eD0XOrcW8b2I data-wc=44>Earlier this year, Frankie appeared on where he emotionally opened up about losing one of his best friends when he was 19-years-old.&nbsp;"He was the best person I'd ever met, he was 19," he explained. "Everyone struggled with it, it was horrible."</p><p id=e1-i40p8KYlj data-wc=62>Frankie admitted that the experience affected his mental health, and following he found himself living a party lifestyle. "And it did get really bad," he confessed. "There were times when I’d just wake up in the morning crying thinking, 'What’s going on?' and it would last for weeks. And I’d ring my dad and he was talking about counselling."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpaWZmfXKAkm1nb21fm7%2BiusqinGabn5i8u8bAZqCsZaWjv6avzqCloquRl7mmecCfq56qXZm%2FornAraCcZaSnrq%2B%2Fxaipppmknryvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-politician-season-2-release-date-story-details-full-cast-revealed-4907-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Politician Season 2 Release Date, Story Details &amp;amp; Full Cast Revealed</span></a>
