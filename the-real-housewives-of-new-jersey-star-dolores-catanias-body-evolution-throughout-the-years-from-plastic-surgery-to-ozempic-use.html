Throughout her time on the Bravo franchise, her look has changed over the years.</p><p>In July 2020, Catania exclusively revealed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> she decided to have a <a href=#>tummy tuck and liposuction</a> while production for season 11 was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“I found the most amazing doctor in Maryland, Dr. Joseph Michaels,” she told Us at the time. “I’ve been up and down with my weight and my elasticity on my skin has gotten shot and well, I’m not going to kill myself over this because it is what it is, but I eat McDonald’s, I didn’t work out for a long time and whatever. … I looked at his Instagram and I almost fell off my couch. It was insane. His before and afters are like nothing I’ve ever seen almost to the fact I thought it was fake!”</p><p>The TV personality opened up about what her plastic surgeon ended up doing for her <a href=#>during the procedure</a>.</p><p>“He did a little fat transfer. So, he took some lipo, he did my back and then he took some of the fat from my back and he made my butt rounder,” she explained while also noting her recovery “was a little rough” compared to other surgeries she had in the past.</p><p>In addition to her weight loss treatment, Catania has also <a href=#>admitted to having a facelift</a> and a boob job in the past. In November 2021, the philanthropist shared she had <a href=#>undergone breast augmentation surgery</a> three times because she was unsatisfied with the previous outcomes.</p><p>“I didn’t like the way they felt. I thought they looked a little uneven, and I just didn’t really like the implants that I used,” she said to <a href=#>RealSelf</a> at the time. “I have a thyroid issue, so I went up and down in weight a lot, and I didn’t like the way [my breast implants] hung as my weight fluctuated. Of course, nobody’s body is symmetrical, but it was such a noticeable difference, and I just wanted them done right.”</p><p>Two years later, Catania continued her journey to achieve her body goals. However, her next method was a controversial one. The RHONJ star <a href=#>confessed to using Ozempic</a> — a <a href=#>medication meant for diabetes</a> — in order to lose weight before she had to appear for the season 13 reunion special for the reality series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to come to the reunion looking any bigger than anyone else, so I got on the bandwagon,” she said to <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in March 2023 about using semaglutide (the generic name for Ozempic) for six weeks.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Catania’s body evolution over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwamxjKucmqRdnby2v8SwoK%2Bdo2K8p3nNnq5mopWnwKbFjKyrmqpdmbytu9Geqmabkamur7XArGSbp5SueqbCzqWsraGfo3q1tNGorKCgn6rBbsDHnmSynZGnwG6y0aikZqiclsC1tcJmqq6ql5q%2FunnTqGSospWivaqvjK6qnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ray-benson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-604790-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ray Benson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
