Now in its third season on Channel 4, Betty - played by actress America Ferrera - is still wearing heavy &#34;train track&#34; braces.
But according to dentists train track braces are very seldom prescribed to adults and even then are not worn for more than two years."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

People considering treatment should not be put off by such a stereotype.</p><p>"Many young people and adults see wearing braces as a right of passage, and enjoy the transformation."</p><p>Dr Colin Wallis, a specialist orthodontist, said: "Braces for adults and children are considerably more discreet than what is being depicted in Ugly Betty.</p><p>"There are many adults in the UK now wearing braces that are either completely clear, or are placed behind the teeth, so you may not even know that your best friend is wearing them.</p><p>"It is completely inappropriate to associate braces with being 'ugly', just as glasses have previously been an object of ridicule."</p><p>Tim Newton, professor of psychology at King's College London's Dental Institute, said: "A student of mine, Huw Jeremiah, has done some work looking at public perceptions of adults wearing orthodontic devices.</p><p>"Essentially he found that adults wearing stainless steel brackets were considered less intelligent than adults with no visible brace, so there are social impacts of wearing braces.</p><p>"There is a long body of psychological research that has found that we tend to think that 'beautiful is good' - that is that attractive people are more popular, socially skilled and intelligent than less attractive people."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJulocG2vsRoq6%2BZnpm%2ForDIqGZucGFsfXOEjn2cp6yZqMG0ecCtq5qbm2KiqLjYZnmerKSuwG6u0ZqanqtencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denise-maerker.html><span>←</span><span>Denise Maerker Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
