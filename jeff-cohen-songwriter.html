As a kid, Cohen would sing songs into a tape recorder and give the cassettes to his sisters. His musical landscape changed at the age of 13, when his mother bought him Jackson Browne’s Hold Out to take to summer camp. He graduated from Oceanside High School in Oceanside, New York in 1984 and then attended Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania where he majored in Government and English. It was during his college years that Cohen began to take guitar and song writing more seriously.

He brought on friend and drummer Pete DeMeo as a co-member, and over the years, they have performed together on special, but rare occasions. Cohen’s first big break came when he landed the theme song on the WB show Jack and Jill. The track, "Truth About Romeo", was written and recorded for the debut self-titled Pancho’s Lament album, released in late 1999/early 2000. Pancho’s Lament’s sophomore album, Leaving Town Alive, was released in early 2003. The band did a limited unreleased pressing of a third album called Three Sides to Every Story in 2008. Pancho's fourth album, Slowly Speeding, featuring Cohen penned songs that have been performed by other artists as well as new material, was released in 2015.
