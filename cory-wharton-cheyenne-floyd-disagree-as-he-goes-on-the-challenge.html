It’s like, do you take this work opportunity and this great chance that you have or do you be there for your family? It’s a tough decision for sure.”</p><p>Since the personal trainer did choose to compete on The Challenge: Spies, Lies and Allies, he had a far different experience than his costars <strong>Nelson</strong> [<strong>Thomas</strong>] and <strong>Fessy</strong> [<strong>Shafaat</strong>], “who get to just check in with themselves and then get to go and … enjoy themselves.”</p><p>Wharton explained, “I have a lot of people at home that depend on me. So when I go to The Challenge, I’m clocking into work. I’m away from my family. … It’s hard on a lot of people.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Ex on the Beach</a> alum is also the father of <a href=#>daughter Mila</a>, 15 months, with <strong>Taylor Selfridge</strong>. As for Floyd, she is engaged to <strong>Zach Davis</strong>, and the pair share<a href=#> son Ace</a>, 1 month.</p><p>Wharton and Davis, 30, both “understand their place in that situation,” Floyd exclusively told Us in January of coparenting.</p><p>“Zach acknowledges that we choose to do things as a family for Ryder,” the <a href=#>Are You the One? </a>alum told Us at the time. “Cory and Zach have their own relationship and have had their chats and everyone’s still alive. So I guess it’s good. … If there’s an issue, we talk about it and move on. So things from the past? Really not a problem.”</p><p>While raising Ryder together seemed “overwhelming” at first, Floyd noted that she and Wharton have<a href=#> “mastered” their dynamic</a> and don’t “hold grudges.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Challenge 37 premieres on MTV Wednesday, August 11, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Emily Longeretta</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacp6Kueri0wKurqKZdmLWmxcSnpZ5llqG8urCMnaCsmZensqZ5wKxkoZ1dnLymv4yopWasmJp6pLTApaOeppeafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./completely-level-html.html><span>←</span><span>Completely level</span></a>
