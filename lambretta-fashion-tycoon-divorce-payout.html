The 61-year-old split with fellow teacher Nicola Briers in 2002 after 18 years of marriage when the business was turning over £1 million a year.
It has since grown into a huge fashion chain incorporating well-known brands Lambretta and Vision Streetwear and makes a £30 million profit."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They were divorced in 2005.</p><p>He says there was an agreement to make a clean break and that divorce judge, Mark Rogers, was wrong to treat the business as "an undivided matrimonial asset."</p><p>Jonathan Cohen QC, for Mr Briers, told the Appeal Court it was unfair for him to now have to share his cash over a decade after the split.</p><p>He added: "The husband started the business with just £81 of his own money.</p><p>"No family money went into the business at all...the wife's involvement in the business was negligible.</p><p>"Her explanation as to why she eventually did make a claim, so many years after the event, was that she had heard that the husband may have had another child before his relationship with the wife; that he had a young girlfriend; her own wages as a teacher had been cut back, and she had parted from her boyfriend, with whom she had been in a relationship since the breakdown of the marriage."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000254693413.jpg><p>But Mr Cohen added: "It is not the husband's role to act as insurer against these events, let alone to do so many years after the separation.</p><p>"This was not an undivided asset - the total assets had been divided, with the husband receiving the company and the wife the bulk of the remaining assets.</p><p>"The judge has provided the wife with a windfall which has no logical justification.</p><p>"It places her in a position which in all the circumstances is excessively favourable."</p><p>The court heard that Brier's wife made no contribution to the business, and that he had actually offered her an extra £562,000 to settle her claim.</p><p>The husband was a dominant personality who sought to prevail in the relationship psychologically and the wife perceived herself as bullied and intimidated</p><span class=quote-credit>Justin Warshaw QC, for Nicola Briers</span><p>Justin Warshaw QC, for Nicola, insisted the payout should be allowed to stand, and that no legal settlement between the former couple had ever been finalised.</p><p>He also claimed that "dominant personality" Briers had "bullied and intimidated" his wife while they were married.</p><p>He added that Mrs Briers deserved her payout due to her "huge contribution" in caring for the children while the company grew.</p><p>Outside court in November, Briers said: "It's just very disappointing. The business went from a turnover of about £1 million when we split to £30 million.</p><p>"I paid for everything. I gave her everything that she wanted and that we agreed on. She got a house valued at £700,000.</p><p>"I didn't drag her up to the solicitors to get the agreement signed - we'd been married for years.</p><p>"I didn't think she would do anything like this years later."</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories!
