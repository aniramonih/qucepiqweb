If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Yoko Ono’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Her name has the meaning of ‘Ocean child.’ She was born into a wealthy family and also associated with a samurai warrior-scholars clan. Her first interaction with music was at the age of four when she started taking piano lessons. She was born in Tokyo but brought up in Tokyo, San Francisco, and New York due to her father’s transfer.</p><p>He was a banker, and her mother was a pianist. She saw World War II and was forced to watch the horrible incidents all through her eyes, which eventually impacted the rest of her life. Her family begged for food, and her mother took all the responsibilities because her father was in a concentration camp at that time.</p><p>She went to Gakushuin University and left after two semesters for unknown reasons. After the war ended, she moved to the US and enrolled herself again at a nearby college. During her college days, she liked meeting artists and influential people from the music background, which her parents disapproved of. They did not even want her lifestyle.</p><p>She escaped from her college again, but this time to be with her love, Toshi Ichiyanagi. She filed for divorce in 1962 and was diagnosed with clinical depression after that. After recovering from the recession, she married a musician, Anthony Cox, which ended in 1969. Her second marriage fell apart on the initial days, but they still stayed together for the sake of her daughter, who was born after a few months of marriage.</p><p>After their divorce, Cox won the custody of their daughter and disappeared after few years of being in the limelight. Meanwhile, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Ono married John Lennon</a>, and they both tried to search her daughter but all in vain.

She also made her band titled ‘Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono’ band. In many of the events, Ono’s voice has been described as one-of-a-kind.</p><p>Her public image was not that amicable, and critics often accuse the celebrity of all her failed relationships. The time when she did not get the custody of her daughter was due to her drug abuse that she became infamous for.</p><p>As an activist, she often conducts concerts and events. After 9/11 happened, she organized ‘Come together’ and raised ample money.</p><p>She and then Husband John Lennon held a ‘Bed-in-for-Peace’ where they both in their pajamas replied to all the questions from media, press, and visitors. This was all conducted as a message for world peace.</p><p>Throughout her career, she made albums, singles, compilations, soundtrack, remixes, and tribute albums.
