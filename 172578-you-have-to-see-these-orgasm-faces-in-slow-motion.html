<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>You Have To See These Orgasm Faces In Slow Motion</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>One of the biggest differences between porn and real life is the orgasm faces. Because let's be real, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>your orgasm face</a> is <i>weird. </i>I'll be the first one to hold my hand up and say: my orgasm face is ugly AF. And maybe a little angry. Or aggressive? In any case, it's definitely not cute. But you know what, I don't know many people's who are— unless they're sitting on some tousled hair, lip biting, throne of lies. That's why I think that these folks who volunteered to have<a href=# class=T3D> their orgasm faces </a>filmed and played in slow motion <i>on the internet </i>are some of the bravest souls around.</p><p>The video, posted on YouTube by user <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>wickydkewl</a>, shows different people hitting the big O for real. And, while I wouldn't say the experience is arousing, it's definitely intimate. And mildly uncomfortable, but in a super cool way. You're a total voyeur into something that's normally really private. I mean, even the people you've had sex with haven't seen your O face on camera. When they've seen it, they've probably been busy and feeling all of the same things as well. So seeing<a href=# class=T3D> just an orgasm</a>, completely out of context, is pretty incredible.</p><p>You can see <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the whole video here</a> and, although it doesn't have anything explicit, I wouldn't <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>exactly call it SFW:</a></p><h3>There's This Face We All Recognize</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>This looks like half of all the men I've slept with.</p><h3>And This Guy</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>... who looks <a href=# class=T3D>like the other half.</a></p><h3>This Serene Dude</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>I have literally never seen anyone so chill having an orgasm in my life. Except for the occasional lick-lip, he just seems so at ease with everything.</p><h3>This Porn Star</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>OK, not an actual porn star, but I think she definitely had the most porn-y orgasm of them all. Not a criticism— they're all cool by me— but just an observation.</p><h3>All Of The Eye Contact</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>This guy, who managed to maintain some real uncomfortable eye contact with the camera all the way...</p><h3>Until The Very End</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Nope, he lost it. But it was a good effort.</p><h3>This Enlightening Experience</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>This woman legit looks like she 1) has <a href=# class=T3D>seen the face of god</a>, 2) is in a sex opera, or 3) both of those things. Either way I'm loving it and her purple lipstick.</p><h3>And The Sweat</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Quite a few of the participants were drenched in sweat by the end, which I actually really liked because sometimes masturbating <i>definitely </i>feels like a work out. Funny faces, sweat — real orgasms happen, people. And they're amazing. Let's get on board with them.</p><p><i>Images: </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>wickydkewl</a>/YouTube</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyg5FubnFlqaTCbrTAr5xmrJ9iwKaxjK2fnquVYryzs8CspGaekZiytHnIp2SspJ%2Bseq6706Kmpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yoko-ono-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Yoko Ono Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
