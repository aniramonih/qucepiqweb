In the second round, the English fighter came out aggressive, but Gordon was tough enough to show his defensive skills. In the third round, both fighters fought nearly the same, but considering all the strikes and defensive qualities, Gordon was the clear winner.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, no one is happy with the judge‚Äôs decision; most of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">media called the decision a robbery</a>, and even Pimblett‚Äôs UFC colleagues reacted negatively regarding the decision.

Dana anticipated that if Gordon fought hard enough, the decision would be made on the octagon rather than on the judge‚Äôs book. At the UFC 282 post-fight press conference, UFC president stated:</p><p>‚ÄúGordon had a horrible game plan going into that third round. You think you won the first two rounds with the judges?
