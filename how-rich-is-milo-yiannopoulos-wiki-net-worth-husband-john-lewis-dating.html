Apart from this, he is also widely recognized for his controversial attitude and journalistic style as well as for being the Breitbart News’ former senior editor.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this popular journalist has accumulated so far? How rich Milo Yiannopoulos is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total of Milo Yiannopoulos’ net worth, as of early 2018, revolves around the sum of $4 million which has been acquired through his career in the world of journalism that has been active since 2007.</p><h3><strong>Milo Yiannopoulos Net Worth $4 Million</strong></h3><p>Apart from being English, Milo is also of Greek ancestry on his father’s side. After his parents divorced at his age of six, Milo was raised by his mother and her new husband before moving to his paternal grandmother during his teenage years, from whom his surname Yiannopoulos comes from. Milo began his education at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury, but from which he was expelled. Later he enrolled at the University of Manchester but dropped out, then went to Wolfson College, Cambridge, from which he also dropped out before obtaining any degree.</p><p>Milo began his professional career at The Catholic Herald. Although initially interested in theater as a critic, he eventually discovered his passion for technology journalism, when he began writing for The Daily Telegraph in 2009. In 2011, Milo co-founded Wrong Agency and launched The Telegraph Tech Start-Up 100 – a program for evaluating and ranking the best and most promising European start-up companies, but which was dissolved in the following year. However, all these ventures provided the basis for Milo Yiannopoulos’ current net worth.</p><p>Alongside a couple of ex-college friends, in November 2011 Milo launched an online magazine fully devoted to technology, named The Kernel. Due to legal issues and funding disputes, the magazine was temporarily shut down in March 2013, however, in the next couple of months, The Kernel was bought-out by venture capital and private equity firm BERLIN42, and relaunched in August 2013 with Milo as its editor-in-chief. After the magazine was acquired by the Daily Dot Media in 2014, Yiannopoulos abandoned his position, but continued serving as an advisor, and it’s certain that this whole experience made an impact on the total of Milo Yiannopoulos’ net worth.</p><p>During 2014 and 2015 he was deeply involved in the “Gamergate controversy”, after criticizing the current trends in video game culture, which resulted in Milo receiving life threats and even the FBI’s interest. In October 2015, Yiannopoulos joined Breitbart News Network and served as the key man of Breitbart Tech ’til February 2017, which also helped Milo Yiannopoulos to increase his popularity, as well as the total of his wealth.</p><p>In January 2016, Milo co-founded the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant, while in mid-2017 he founded a media outlet named Milo, Inc. focused on “the destruction of political correctness”. Apart from all those already mentioned, under the alias Milo Andreas Wagner he published several books, of which “Eskimo Papoose” released in 2007 is the most memorable. In July 2017, his autobiography entitled “Dangerous” hit the shelves, and was an instant commercial success, peaking at No. 2 on the New York Times’ non-fiction bestselling list, as well as No. 1 on the Publisher Weekly’s bestseller chart. Doubtlessly, all these achievements have helped Milo Yiannopoulos to increase the size of his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, despite all the controversies he has managed to keep it somehow private as there aren’t much details about his love live, except that since September 2017 Milo Yiannopoulos has been married to his long-term boyfriend John.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=10><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Jones & Co</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Paul Murray Live</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Studio 10</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Blogger and Commentator</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Latham's Outsiders</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Sunrise</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>America Under Siege: Antifa</td><td>2017</td><td>Documentary short</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Bolt Report</td><td>2016-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Breitbart News / Himself / Himself - Conservative Blogger</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Real Time with Bill Maher</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Guest</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Justice w/Judge Jeanine</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Breitbart News Senior Editor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Tucker Carlson Tonight</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Breitbart News Senior Editor</td></tr><tr><td>Lateline</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Joe Rogan Experience</td><td>2015-2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Louder with Crowder</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Guest</td></tr><tr><td>The Big Questions</td><td>2014-2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Drunken Peasants</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Guest</td></tr><tr><td>Silenced</td><td>2016</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Reggie Yates' Extreme UK</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Mini-Series documentary</td><td>Himself - Journalist</td></tr><tr><td>American Milo</td><td>2015</td><td>Documentary short</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>It Was Alright in the 70s</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Postal 2: Paradise Lost</td><td>2015</td><td>Video Game</td><td>Himself (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Channel 4 News</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Newsnight</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Journalist</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>10 O'Clock Live</td><td>2011-2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Jounralist and social commentator / Himself - Catholic Herald / Himself - Student and Columnist, Daily Telegraph</td></tr><tr><td>Free Speech</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqGmsGWinrCpecisZKahnKR6urXAp6WoqJ%2BqubC%2FjLCgpKFdo7K1edaoqa2gXZ3CtK7Ap5tmop%2Bdu264xLCgrGWUlsGqusZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-wiens-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Mark Wiens Achieved a Net Worth of $6.5 Million</span></a>
