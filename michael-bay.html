Yet somehow, I come under special scrutiny. I mean, why don’t people get upset if Dow spends $300 million to invent some new chemical? Audiences like popcorn movies. What’s wrong with that?”&nbsp;<strong>– Michael Bay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“We don’t make movies for critics. I’ve done four movies; there are millions upon millions upon millions of people who’ve paid to see them. Somebody likes them. My greatest joy is to sit anonymously in a dark theater and watch it with an audience, a paying audience.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Michael Bay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Everybody knows about Pearl Harbor. The thing that really fascinated me is that through this tragedy there was this amazing American heroism.”<strong>&nbsp;– Michael Bay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“What I look for in a script is something that challenges me, something that breaks new ground, something that allows me to flex my director’s muscle. You have got to think fast in this business, you’ve got to keep reinventing yourself to stay on top.”<strong>&nbsp;–</strong><strong>Michael Bay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The press don’t like to say nice things because nice is boring. It’s much better to label me the devil. What we do is not brain surgery. We are entertainers, plain and simple, and we’re responsible to bring that money back, to make a profit.”<strong>– Michael Bay&nbsp;</strong></p><p>3 Moviemaking Tips from Michael Bay</p><p>Let’s look at some of the most valuable lessons we can take away from Michael Bay now that you are fully aware of his net worth and the path to his success:</p><h3>1. Know Your Audience</h3><p>Bay speaks on how he picks projects that he believes will be successful near the end of the MSNBC video above, specifically mentioning the Transformers movies and how he tries to make them as accessible as possible.</p><p>“You must have some vision. I followed my instinct. Because I wasn’t a fan of the Transformers, you need to make them approachable for non-fans.</p><h3>2. Study Musicals, Perform Magic</h3><p>The notion that magic is simply cutting-edge science and technology that humans aren’t yet accustomed to is one that is heavily explored in Michael Bay’s fifth Transformers film, Transformers: The Last Knight.</p><p>That makes sense coming from a director who views filmmaking as magic and magicians. When Bay enrolled in his musicals course, it greatly aided his pursuit of a profession as a director.</p><h3>3. Action Movies are Like Compositions</h3><p>The fact that Bay has never produced a musical himself is shocking, although perhaps it shouldn’t be given that few musicals earn $1 billion or more (perhaps the success of Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast will persuade Bay otherwise?).</p><p>The former music video director discusses another way action movies and music should be viewed in relation to one another in a 2013 Mother Jones piece. He also describes himself as a composer.</p><h2>Questions and Answers</h2><h3>How much money does he make?</h3><p>He has a $450 million or so overall net worth.</p><h3>What is his age?</h3><p>He is 57 years old right now (17 February 1965).</p><h3>What is his annual salary?</h3><p>He makes an annual compensation of $40 million, according to estimates.</p><h3>What is his Height?</h3><p>He stands 1.85 m (6′ 0″) tall.</p><h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Michael Bay is an American film director and producer who was the director and executive producer for the sequels, “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen”, “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”. Bay has received five MTV Movie Awards for “Transformers”, “Pearl Harbor”, “Bad Boys II” and “The Rock”.</p><h3>As of November 2022, Michael Bay’s net worth is estimated to be $450 Million.</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKWZmLWisctmmZqxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sheila-hafsadi.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Sheila Hafsadi- Meet Wife of the Twilight Saga actor, Jackson Rathbone</span></a>
