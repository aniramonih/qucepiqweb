The pressure hull was most certainly breached, but it’s not clear what brought it about in the first place.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A leak, a power outage, or a minor fire from an electrical short circuit might all be to blame for such an implosion, a professor of marine robotics at the University of Sydney whose lab works with uncrewed submersibles.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The submersible’s design has also raised questions about its safety. <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Director and explorer James Cameron</a><a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;told Good Morning America</a> on Friday, 23 June:</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>“lead to catastrophic failure.” Explaining that “Each dive adds more and more microscopic damage, So yes, they operated this sub safely at Titanic this year and the year before, but it was only a matter of time before it caught up with them.”</p><p style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cameron told ABC News</a> that the vessel’s censors warned the passengers of the dange<span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"ɼ"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":20608,"10":2,"15":"Arial","17":1}'>ɼ</span>:</p><p style=text-align:justify>“We understand from inside the community that they had dropped their ascent weights and they were coming up, trying to manage an emergency.”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>It’s too soon to say whether the submersible’s implosion occurred when it lost communication with its mothership around an hour and a half after launch or later as it descended to the RMS Titanic.
