Cancer is a genetic concern for her family, caused by a lack of BRCA gene mutation. Her sister, mother, grandmother, and aunt had all died as a result of this lethal sickness. She had a mastectomy (a breast operation that removes a woman’s breasts) twice and recovered entirely with fresh silicone implants.</p><p>Even though she had not been diagnosed with cancer, she opted to have this operation since her developing cancer was a significant possibility. Initially, she had a mastectomy. When one week, she had another surgery after growth was discovered on her tissue, which had a 15% risk of turning malignant. During this challenging moment, her spouse supports her choice and stands behind her as a loving pillar.</p><h2>Two lovely youngsters</h2><p>The couple has two lovely children. The first is Aurora, the daughter named after the Northern Lights, Aurora Borealis. The next one is Ashton, a son who is an athlete and enjoys riding motorcycles. He is her mother’s greatest supporter, according to her website. Jacqui’s reputation is growing due to her work on The Weather Channel.
