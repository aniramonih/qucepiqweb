The sport involves two competitors on either side of a podium taking turns to slap each other in the face as hard as they can.
The aim is to knock out or make your opponent quit and the results can be extremely brutal as evidenced in a recent RXF event in Romania.
Sorin Comsa survived ten rounds and a badly swollen face to stop his opponent who surrendered after taking one slap too many on Monday."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
