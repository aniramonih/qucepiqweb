They handcuffed him and started interrogating him.&nbsp;</p><p>His cameraman was present during the exchange and filmed everything. The video went viral on Twitter after Esports's&nbsp;insider Jake Lucky shared it.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, someone had falsely reported him as a threat. In the footage, IShowSpeed looked visibly disoriented and afflicted throughout the incident. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Oh my god, bro! I swear I didn’t do anything,” he said in disbelief and kept repeating he was innocent.&nbsp;</p><p>A police officer then approached the cameraman and asked him to stop filming while they tried to figure things out.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Jake Lucky shares a video of IShowSpeed being swatted during a live stream.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But when the cameraman did not stop, the officer pushed the phone away, and that is where the stream&nbsp;ended.</p><p>In the background, IShowSpeed could be heard talking with the officers about the situation.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The situation had IShowSpeed’s fans on edge. Many within the streaming community criticized the officer for the way he treated the cameraman, stating that forcing them to stop filming was illegal.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Adin Ross Says IShowSpeed Is&nbsp;Okay</h2><p>The news of IShowSpeed’s swatting came after the SWAT team targeted popular streamer <a href=# rel=follow>Adin Ross</a>&nbsp;during his broadcast on August 7, 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Ross was streaming&nbsp;some gambling content when suddenly four police officers entered with weapons in their hands.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the streamer re-entered his room and ended the stream by saying, “Whatever troll did it, you did it. You officially did it. It’s never happening ever again. Crazy. […] That was insane.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The reason for Ross being swatted is unknown, but this is not the first time streamers have been swatted.&nbsp;</p><p>Online trolls privy to the streamers’ addresses see this as a prank and call the SWAT team on them.</p><p>Fans were worried for Ross, but on August 9, he got on Twitter and reassured everyone he was okay.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“I got swatted last night, very scary. But I’m okay, and I love you guys. Also, Speed got swatted as well, we just got off the phone he’s okay!
