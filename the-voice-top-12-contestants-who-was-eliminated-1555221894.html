They happen after the auditions, where the judges can't see the singers, and before the knockout rounds. In the Battles, the coaches make two of their team members sing together to figure out who's better. Both singers sing the same song as a duet, showing how good they are at singing and performing on stage. After they sing, the coach has to pick one to go to the next round, and the other might have to leave the competition.</p><p>What's cool about the Battle rounds is that if a coach doesn't pick a singer, other coaches can say they want that singer for their team. It's like a surprise second chance for the singer to work with a different coach.</p><p>The Battle rounds aren't just about singing; they also test the coaches to make smart choices for their teams. These rounds help decide who will go to the next round called the knockouts, where singers face new challenges and performances. In the end, "The Voice" Battle rounds are a really important and exciting part of the show that adds a lot of drama and excitement.</p><h2>The Voice American 24 Overview</h2><table cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><p>Host</p></td><td><p>Carson Daly</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Coaches</p></td><td><p>John Legend, Gwen Stefani, Niall Horan, Reba McEntire</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>No. of Contestants</p></td><td><p>56 artists</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>No. of Episodes</p></td><td><p>12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Original Network</p></td><td><p>NBC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Original Release</p></td><td><p>September 25, 2023 – Present</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>The Voice Top 12 Contestants - FAQs</h2>1.
