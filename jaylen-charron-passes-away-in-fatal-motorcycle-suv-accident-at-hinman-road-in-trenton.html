The collision involved multiple vehicles and occurred at the intersection of State Route 12 and Hinman Road, leaving family and friends grappling with the sudden loss.</p><p>The accident transpired when a 2013 Subaru Crosstrek, driven by 61-year-old Roberta J. Shields, attempted to turn left onto Hinman Road from State Route 12. Tragically, Shields did not see Jaylen J. Charron, who was riding a Yamaha motorcycle southbound on State Route 12. The collision resulted in a devastating impact, leading to Jaylen’s untimely demise.</p><p>Upon the collision, Shields’ vehicle spun and collided with a stationary 2018 Chevrolet pickup truck operated by Joshua A. Buck of Remsen. This chain of events left the community in shock and disbelief, as Jaylen was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.</p><p>The tragedy saw Shields and her two passengers sustaining minor injuries, necessitating their transportation to St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center for medical attention. Meanwhile, Buck and his passenger remained unharmed, providing a glimmer of relief amid the somber incident.</p><p>The New York State Police in Remsen were swift to respond to the scene, offering assistance and initiating the investigation. The loss of Jaylen Charron, a young individual with a promising life ahead, serves as a poignant reminder of the need for road safety and vigilance on the part of all drivers. The community stands together, offering condolences and support to the grieving family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kt6LFy56lZpuYlr%2Bzu81mp5qro5rAbq3WmrBmoZ5is6LAwKVkpqekpL%2BkxcKlnGarpat6oq%2FCopuepqRirrV5x6KlppmeYr%2BwrcNmoKdlpKeyr8DOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./janine-schneider-marsan-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-124765-html.html><span>←</span><span>Janine Schneider-Marsan Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
