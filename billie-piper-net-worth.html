She began her artistic career as a pop singer in her teens, later focusing on her career as an actress. The role that made her famous was that of Rose Tyler in the new version of the mythical television series “Doctor Who” (2005 – 2013). Piper has been active in the entertainment industry since 1998.</p><p>How rich is the actress and singer? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the overall size of Billie Piper net worth is as much as $12 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017. Music, films and television are the sources of Piper’s wealth.</p><h3>Billie Piper Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Piper ‘s parents had named her Lianne, but only three weeks after her birth they changed her name to Billie. Piper has a younger brother and two younger sisters, and grew up in Nine Elms, Swindon, where she attended the Brookfield Primary School in Shaw, and then Bradon Forest Secondary School. She subsequently studied at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.</p><p>Concerning her professional career, she began as a teenager in the television show “Scratchy and Co”. Later, she worked for a commercial magazine “Smash Hits”, but at the age of 15 she signed her first record deal. In 1998, she was the youngest artist ever to reach the top on the UK Top 40 with the song “Because We Want To”, and her next single “Girlfriend” (1999) also topped the music charts. This was followed by a number of major hit singles and two successful albums, which were also successful outside Britain and Ireland, in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and later Switzerland, steadily building her net worth.</p><p>In 2003, she decided to stop singing, and went to Los Angeles to attend acting classes, afterwards appearing in the series “The Canterbury Tales” (2003). This was followed by a number of roles in series and movies, until in 2005 she was cast in “Doctor Who”, she starring with both <a href=#>Christopher Eccleston</a> and <a href=#>David Tennant</a>. In late 2007, Piper starred in the television series “Secret Diary of a Call Girl”, which was a huge success thanks to the intensive promotional campaign that preceded the series in which extensive use was made of Pipers stardom. The series became the most watched drama series on ITV2. In 2008, Piper appeared again in the role of Rose Tyler in “Doctor Who”, and in 2013 she returned to Doctor Who for the 50-year special “The Day of the Doctor”. In this episode she played The Moment which had taken the form of Rose Tyler. From 2014 to 2016, she starred in the series “Penny Dreadful” for which she was nominated for a Fangoria Chainsaw Award. Soon, the feature film “Beast” (2017) should be screened, in which she takes the role of Grace.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Billie Piper, she married British radio DJ Chris Evans in 2001, but in 2004 they separated, and divorced in 2007. At the end of 2007, she married the actor Laurence Fox, the son of actor James Fox. They lived in Eastbourne, Midhurst in the English West Sussex, and had two sons together before divorcing in 2016.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=35.23642732049><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Billie Piper</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 22, 1982</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Swindon, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 4 in (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Singer, Television producer</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Brookfield Primary School in Shaw, Bradon Forest Secondary School, Sylvia Young Theatre School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Laurence Fox (m. 2007), Chris Evans (m. 2001–2007)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Eugene Pip Fox, Winston James Fox</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Mandy Kane Kent, Paul Piper</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Harley Piper, Elle Piper, Charlie Piper</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nicknames</td><td>Billy Piper , Billie , Leian Paul Piper , Billie Paul Piper , Lianne Paul Piper , Lianne Piper , Robin Brown-Loetscher</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/BilliePiperOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/billiepiper</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33962264150943><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/billiepiperonline/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684877</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/billie-piper-mn0000644262</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Awards</td><td>Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress (2017), Critics' Circle Theatre Award for Best Actress (2017), National Television Award for Most Popular Actress, Glamour Award for UK TV Actress (2010, 2006), Glamour Award for Theatre Actress (2017, 2014), WhatsOnStage Award for Best Actress in a Play</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Albums</td><td>Honey to the B (1998), Walk of Life (2000), The Best of Billie (2005), 5 Bites (2012, EP), The Singles Collection (2012)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Fangoria Chainsaw Award</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>Mansfield Park (2007), The Calcium Kid (20040, Spirit Trap (2005), Beast (2017), Two for Joy (2017), City of Tiny Lights (2016)</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>TV Shows</td><td>Doctor Who (2005-2013), Yerma (2016-2017), Scratchy & Co.
