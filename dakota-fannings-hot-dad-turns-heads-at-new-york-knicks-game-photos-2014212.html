Dressed in a chic black-and-white blouse and ripped jeans, the stylish star was upstaged by her swoon-worthy father, who caused quite a splash on social media.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=501 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Elle Fanning and Dad" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The 47-year-old dad to Dakota and little sister <strong><a href=#>Elle Fanning</a></strong> took a seat in a black long-sleeved T-shirt, jeans, and a blue branded Knicks hat. He seemed to be having a ball with his older daughter, laughing and clapping as they took in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Sports are a familiar territory for Steve, <a href=#>who played minor league baseball</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Troy University alum played infield positions for a variety of AAA, AA, and A teams, doing stints in Des Moines, Iowa, Louisville, Ky., and North Little Rock, Ark.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=616 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Steve Fanning baseball card" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Now working as an electronics salesman in California, Steve welcomed Dakota and Elle, 16, with wife <strong>Heather</strong>. The acclaimed, successful young actresses remain close to their parents, and have been seen hitting the gym with their dad and heard gushing about their mom.&nbsp;</p><p>“My mom and I have been pretty much together my whole life, because when I was working before I was 18 she was always with me,” <a href=#>Dakota told The Telegraph in 2012 about striking out on her own</a>. “So I’ve missed her a lot, and I’ve missed my whole family and my house and dog, but then I appreciate it all so much more when I go home. It’s good never to take anything for granted.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZukwaJ5xZqlp6GenMButM6tZJ2ZlGLBtr7NrGShnZGZwG6t02alnq9drryzt4ykpaKbm6h6qK3MnmSpoJ%2BpvLR5kWlobWphZ3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courts-power-move-trump-business-dissolution-paused.html><span>←</span><span>Court's Power Move: Trump Business Dissolution Paused</span></a>
