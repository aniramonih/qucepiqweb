The rumors date back to as early as 2016, apparently fueled by the constant comparisons between the two artists. However, the situation seemed to escalate in 2019 when Scott made some shady comments about Rocky during a Rolling Loud performance. Rocky, for his part, openly expressed his annoyance at being constantly mistaken for the Houstonian rapper, even going as far as claiming that Scott stole his entire style. In a recent interview with the Drink Champs podcast, Rocky was asked directly about this accusation. When host Nore asked if Travis Scott stole his whole style from A$AP Rocky, the "Fuckin Problems" rapper replied with a simple "Yeah". However, it's worth noting that Rocky himself has cited Houston as a major influence on his own music, despite being a New York native. He has spoken in the past about how the legendary hip-hop group UGK, comprised of Houston's own Bun B and the late Pimp C, greatly impacted him growing up. In fact, in 2011, Rocky released a song titled "Houston Old Head" that paid homage to the people who influenced him in the Texas area. So while there may be some similarities between Rocky and Scott's styles, it's clear that both artists have their own unique musical influences and approaches. Only time will tell if this rumored beef will ever truly escalate into a full-blown feud. But for now, it seems that both A$AP Rocky and Travis Scott will continue to make their mark on the hip-hop world in their own distinct ways.</p><h2><strong>Asap Rocky Travis Scott Twins&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;Asap Rocky And Travis Scott are not twins.
