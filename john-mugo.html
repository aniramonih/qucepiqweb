His friend and colleague announced the sad news in a post on Facebook.</p><h2>What happened to John Mugo?</h2><p>John Mugo, a Kenyan travel nurse, was on an assignment in a New York hospital and has been reported missing. According to the reports, he had recently started a nursing assignment and was preparing to fly home to Atlanta, Georgia, on December 24, 2023. But he never made it home; his family reported to the authorities, and a</p><p>widespread search and rescue operation was put in place to find him.<br>His concerned family and friends reached out to the online community to help locate him in the hopes of reuniting with their loved one.</p><p>“Please help us find our brother and best friend, John Mugo, RN. John Mugo is a Travel RN. He had just started an assignment in a New York Hospital. Unfortunately, we don’t know what travel agency he was with to the hospital he was posted in. John Mugo was flying home to Atlanta on Christmas Eve. He never got home. We’re worried and concerned. His phone has been going to VM.”</p><p>Travel nurses are employed by an independent nursing staffing agency instead of a single faculty. Their assignments are usually 13 weeks in duration but could be as short as four weeks or as long as 26 weeks.</p><h2>Has John Mugo been Found?</h2><p>Yes, John Mugo has been found. But sadly, he is no more. It is unclear what caused his tragic, untimely death. His last known whereabouts were at the airport on December 24, as he was preparing to board a flight to Atlanta. His sudden disappearance and cause of death are shrouded in mystery, adding to the grief.</p><p>His friend, Ben Giteau, announced the sad news on Friday, January 5, 2024.</p><p>“It is with deepest sadness that we announce the passing of our Brother and Friend, John N. Mugo. Our thoughts and prayers to his Family at this very difficult time.”<br>He also expressed gratitude to the community for their prayers, concern, and support. He also assured everyone that he would update them on every way they could support his grieving family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2S5sK%2FApWajp5ijeq7Bxqhm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-kernen-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Kernen Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
