Read on to see 5 of Ann-Kathrin Brömmel's top diet, beauty, and fitness tips for staying in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span>30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/GettyImages-1427585255.jpg><p><span>Ann-Kathri made a YouTube vlog during the pandemic, detailing her morning ritual. In it, she revealed her favorite beauty tool, which she uses daily: Nurse Jamie UpLift Facial Massaging Beauty Roller. She claims it helps to depuff her skin. "Massaging your face so lightly," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/GettyImages-1427585248.jpg><p><span>Ann-Kathrin is one of the many models and celebrities who starts their day with a popular Ayurvedic drink. "The first thing I drink in the morning is warm water with lemon," she dished in the vlog. To add extra antioxidants, she sometimes includes green tea in the drink.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/GettyImages-1426960921.jpg><p><span>Ann-Kathrin does not starve herself. Instead she fuels up in the morning with a hearty but healthy breakfast. She starts by cooking apples in a pan with butter. Then, she cooks a big bath of oatmeal with oat milk for extra calcium. What makes it the "perfect breakfast"? She says that it is super filling, versatile (you can add whatever fruit you want), high in fiber, helps lower blood pressure, and boasts lots of antioxidants.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ann-Kathrin encourages regular movement. She enjoys staying in shape by walking with her stroller in the city or hiking in the mountains with her husband. Why should you go for a walk or hike? One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day boasts many benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death.</span></p><p><span>Ann eats fruits and veggies but also drinks them. During her vlog she and her husband make a beverage in the juicer, adding carrot, red beet, apple, ginger, and celery. "</span>Consider blending instead of juicing. Blending the edible parts of fruits and vegetables produces a drink that contains more healthy phytonutrients and fiber. Fiber can help you feel full," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>. "If you try juicing, make only as much juice as you can drink at once; harmful bacteria can grow quickly in freshly squeezed juice. If you buy commercially produced fresh juice, select a pasteurized product."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkmqaeYriiwMeroKdlkqe8rrnEpWSipl2XrrW0yKeeZqulnsFuv8Cyqmamn2K8r7GMpaCknaNiwKmtw7Jkm52RmLWmv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andy-mauer-age-net-worth-wiki-family-biography-and-latest-updates.html><span>←</span><span>Andy Mauer age, net worth, wiki, family, biography and latest updates</span></a>
