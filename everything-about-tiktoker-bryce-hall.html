The biggest ones employ a whole roster of people to help them with their business, with most at the very least hiring a manager to negotiate deals and seek out opportunities. For people like Bryce Hall, there are simply too many opportunities and requests to handle without someone filtering through them.</p><p>But before Hall took more control of his career with the creation of the Sway House, he was previously represented by talent agent, Michael Weist, who at the time was the founder of the company, Good Times Entertainment, LLC. According to Weist's interview in the social media documentary, "Jawline" (via <a href=#>Refinery29</a>), he stopped working for Hall in 2017, and the social media star went on to tweet claims that Weist had sexually assaulted him and hacked into his X, formerly known as Twitter, account, along with another client, Mikey Barone.</p><p>Weist brought a lawsuit against both creators, which was ultimately settled out of court. Hall issued a public apology. "I made some harsh statements about Michael and regret making those statements, including any suggestion of sexual assault," Hall said in the <a href=#>statement</a>. "I am sorry for what happened and I am glad it is over."&nbsp;Hall went on to be managed by Brad Baskin of Panther Talent, after leaving TalentX,&nbsp;the management behind Sway House.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
