A stop on Chelsea Lately, where Chelsea Handler did the heavy lifting and told the audience about Gwyneth’s “advice” to ladies fighting with their men. I’ll spare you the build-up: if you’re mad at your man, don’t yell at him, just go down on him. Goop-Style (Goop-Style = pinkies in the air as you stroke).</p><p></p><p>She paints herself as a domestic goddess, and once encouraged people to ‘nourish the inner aspect’ on her pretentious Goop lifestyle website.

Classic GOOP.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_AAR_BlueBookBall_041813_51072059.jpg alt title=FFN_AAR_BlueBookBall_041813_51072059 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_RIJ_IRON_MAN3_042413_51078052.jpg alt title=FFN_RIJ_IRON_MAN3_042413_51078052 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3FlZoB6e8awsKedpJ2ssa3Lramor6OUrqXCyJycmJ6fp6y4u8yepZiZnpy%2FuqvWoquhl6Sdsqq%2BvqGsrJqRo7G0q44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greg-zuerlein-biography-height-wife-nicknames-salary-family.html><span>←</span><span>Greg Zuerlein biography, height, wife, nicknames, salary, family</span></a>
