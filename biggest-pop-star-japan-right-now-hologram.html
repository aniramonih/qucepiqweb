A Hologram Who Sells Out Stadiums Full Of Rea</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=p1>When it comes to weird inventions, Japan seems to have cornered the market.&nbsp; In fact, they even have an entire category of products known as Chindogu, or products invented just to see how wacky the creators could be.&nbsp; Japan is a leader in product research, so even when the inventions are completely bizarre (floor-dusting baby onesie, anyone?), they do actually seem to serve a purpose.&nbsp; One of the more interesting inventions to come out of Japan in recent years, is the <strong>Hatsune Miku</strong>&nbsp;voice synthesizer created by <strong>Crypton Future Media</strong>.&nbsp; Originally created simply to act as a synthesizer, Hatsune Miku has grown into a world-wide holographic phenomenon, with millions of fans.&nbsp; During its first year, in 2007, it became the #1 selling software in Japan, and racked up sales of <strong>57.5 million yen</strong> (approx. $600,000) in that year alone.&nbsp; A true "cyber celebrity", possibly the first of its kind, Hatsune Miku has become one of Japan's most successful inventions, and a cottage industry unlike any other.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194123 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GettyImages-457447986.jpg alt="Hatsune Miku" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194123 class=wp-caption-text>Hatsune Miku / SEBASTIEN BERDA/AFP/Getty Images</p><p class=p1>First released in 2007, Hatsune Miku was created using <strong>Yamaha</strong>'s Vocaloid 2 and Vocaloid 3 programs. The designers used multiple voice samples from Saki Fujita, a popular Japanese voice over artist.&nbsp; They chose their samples very carefully, so that each sample had a Japanese or English phonic.&nbsp; When the phonics were combined, they could create words, phrases, and song lyrics.&nbsp; All of the samples became the sonic foundation for a keyboard type instrument, and pitch could be altered through the synthesizer program.&nbsp; The company chose the name Hatsune Miku because the name merges the Japanese characters for "first", "sound", and "future" – signifying "first sound from the future".</p><p class=p1>In the past, <strong>Vocaloid</strong> programs had gone the sonic route only.&nbsp; It was a huge departure to create a visual representation of the Vocaloid program.&nbsp; Crypton Future Media was uncertain if it would have an impact on sales, but they decided to go for it anyway.&nbsp; In order to market the program, Crypton created an "android diva" persona with a backstory about a near-future world where songs had been lost.&nbsp; They turned to popular manga artist, <strong>Kei Garo</strong>, to create a visual that would appeal to the audience of professional producers at which the program was aimed.&nbsp; He was given two guidelines – the coloring used had to be the colors of the synthesizer program, and she had to be an android.&nbsp; He came up with a slim figure in a futuristic school-girl outfit with long turquoise pigtails.&nbsp; The character has her own profile.&nbsp; She's a 5-foot, 92-pound, sixteen year old girl, born on August 31st.&nbsp; Her favorite musical genres are listed as Japanese Pop (J-Pop) and Dance Pop.&nbsp; As she is a musical construct, the company also lists her favorite tempos as anywhere from 70 – 150 BPM and her vocal range from A3 to E5. Check her out in concert:</p><p></p><p class=p1>While Yamaha provided the framework on which the program was built, they have only been involved in marketing the program and cyber figure peripherally.&nbsp; Instead, most of the marketing has fallen to the development teams for Vocaloid, and her popularity has outpaced their wildest expectations.&nbsp; The entire Vocaloid phenomenon, of which Hatsune Miku is just one example, has become incredibly lucrative.&nbsp; Crypton Future Media is at the forefront of Vocaloid promotion, and the company has collaborated with a number of famous brands.&nbsp; Hatsune Miku has been part of a major marketing campaign with the <strong>GT300</strong> since 2008.&nbsp; Crypton and Good Smile Racing have sponsored multiple racing teams, as well.&nbsp; Along with a number of other Vocaloid characters, who make up the Character Vocal Series, Hatsune Miku artwork has appeared on race cars for Studie, Team MOLA, and Team COX.&nbsp; In addition to endorsing cars, the Hatsune Miku image has been used to promote the <strong>Toyota Corolla</strong> and in promotions for Sapporo, <strong>SEGA</strong>, and <strong>Google Chrome</strong>.</p><p class=p1>What has driven her popularity more than anything, has been user response.&nbsp; When the program was first released, Crypton actually couldn't keep up with demand.&nbsp; They had a waiting list of 3,000 by the 12th day that the program was on sale back in 2007.&nbsp; After the program was first released, producers began posting short multi-media videos of songs they'd created using the program to <strong>Nico Nico Douga</strong>, the Japanese equivalent of YouTube.&nbsp; Soon Nico Nico Douga users began collaborating, creating original music videos and other content featuring Hatsune Miku's image.&nbsp; Her popularity grew so much, that a petition was created to send her image into space.&nbsp; It ended up receiving 14,000 signatures, and on May 21, 2010, three aluminum plates featuring her image were launched into space on the Akatsuki spacecraft explorer.&nbsp; To date, there have been over 1 million images of her created by fans.&nbsp; Over 170,000 videos featuring her image have been uploaded to YouTube, and 100,000 songs featuring her have been released.&nbsp; She has nearly <strong>1,000,000</strong> fans on Facebook.</p><p class=p1>In 2013, Crypton released an English-language version of the software, and her popularity increased exponentially.&nbsp; The growth of user created content was spurred by Crypton's decision to adapt "Creative Commons License CC BY-NY", so that it became legal for users to create as much original content, using her original image, as they wanted.&nbsp; She is viewed as her own musical entity, and has released albums and singles as a music artist.&nbsp; Her album, "Exit Tunes Presents Vocalgenesis feat. Hatsune Miku", became the first Vocaloid album to chart at #1 back in 2010.&nbsp; She has since gone on to perform sold-out live concerts in Asia and the United States, including a gig at Los Angeles' Nokia Theater in 2011.&nbsp; She was the star of a Vocaloid opera called, "The End", that only used Vocaloid performers.&nbsp; Written by Keiichiro Shibuya, and designed by famed artist, Louis Vuitton, the opera premiered at the Chatelet Opera House in late 2013 to surprisingly strong reviews.&nbsp; Since then, she has also opened for <strong><a href=# title="Lady Gaga Net Worth">Lady Gaga</a></strong>'s "ArtRave: The Artpop Ball" tour, and been featured in <strong><a href=# title="Pharrell Williams Net Worth">Pharrell Williams</a></strong>' remix of "Last night, Good night" by Livetune.</p><p class=p1>No one quite knows how far the Hatsune Miku phenomenon will go.&nbsp; There's been nothing like it before. &nbsp;Her community of fans and followers just keeps growing and growing. &nbsp;She is definitely one of the most successful inventions to come out of Japan in years. &nbsp;Her live concerts are both stunning to look at and genuinely eerie.&nbsp; She's a hologram and her vocals are being played on a keyboard, but for a couple of hours, to a couple thousand people, she is as real as you or I.&nbsp; If that's not a totally futuristic concept, it's tough to know what is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJomaKfl5rAtXnPqKdmq6SWv262wKmYp2WinrSpwIynprBlmKS5sLPRmqRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tellef-lundevall-wikipedia-biography-age-height-nationality-ethnicity-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Tellef Lundevall Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Height, Nationality, Ethnicity, Dating</span></a>
