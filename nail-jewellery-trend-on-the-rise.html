They’ve had a slew of comments, calling them “futuristic” and “dainty”, and plenty asking how to recreate the looks themselves. Growing up, we were no stranger to fiddly nail stickers, but now we’re totally on board with minimalist, modern nail jewellery. On their website, they say that they “lead trend colors, patterns and styles throughout the nail season” and “want to maximize women's femininity and help style completion". We spoke to Unistella who explained that they are applied with "a screw, which sticks on the nails with nail glue". They also said that they get their designs from "everywhere they can see".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee7deae35a86-nail-unistella-jewellery-manicure-art-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e1OODoUhriN5 data-wc=1><strong>Photo: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Unistella</a></strong></p><p id=euHSvD6VhxXv data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>In other weird and wonderful nail ideas, have you seen this royal wedding nail art?</a></strong></p><p id=ejXCfeLnLO2n data-wc=68>However, they don’t look entirely suitable for our office jobs, because wouldn't those large gems get ever so slightly in the way while we’re typing?
