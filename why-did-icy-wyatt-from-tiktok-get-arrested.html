Among the controversial sea of creators, there’s one name that’s been making waves time and time again, but sadly for all the wrong reasons and this creator is none other than Wyatt Yaegar, or as you might know him,<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Icy Wyatt</a>.</strong> The TikTok sensation has skyrocketed to fame with his lip-syncing skills, captivating daily vlogs, and his undeniable magnetic personality.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>With a staggering fanbase of over 1.3 million followers amassed in just a few short years, Icy Wyatt has undeniably become a force to be reckoned with in the TikTok universe, however, his recent reappearance in the limelight has brought along a whole new wave of controversy. In 2022, this influential content creator got caught up in some legal trouble, and the much-anticipated bodycam footage has just reached the eyes of the public.</p><h2 id=h-why-was-icy-wyatt-arrested data-injectable=false>Why was Icy Wyatt arrested?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>The highly anticipated moment has come, and the bodycam arrest of Icy Wyatt has finally been released to the public. The video reveals a heated altercation between Wyatt, law enforcement, and onlookers, with the influencer fiercely resisting the authorities and vehemently opposing his arrest. This violent incident occurred in March of 2022, unfolding at a Chick-Fil-A parking lot, and resulting in a series of charges against the content creator.</p><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>According to police reports cited by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, the influencer was driving recklessly before abruptly stopping his car in the middle of the road. After receiving multiple 911 calls reporting his erratic behavior, the police were called to intervene. The reports also indicate that the influencer was in possession of a gun and had threatened witnesses at the scene before the police arrived. In addition to displaying uncooperative behavior towards the authorities, the influencer also attempted to exploit his fame in an effort to evade the arrest altogether.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@icywyatt href=#>@icywyatt</a><p>Youtube is icywyatt</p><a title="♬ original sound - Icy Wyatt" href=#>♬ original sound – Icy Wyatt</a></figure><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>Even with overwhelming evidence supporting the arrest, the influencer adamantly criticizes the police force, refuting the allegations with a simple statement: “The rumors are not true.” However, the legal system tells a different tale. Wyatt found himself behind bars, facing serious charges including two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (without intent to kill), one count of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, one count of battery on an officer, and one count of resisting arrest.</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>Despite the weight of the accusations, he pleaded not guilty to all five charges and is presently awaiting his court date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMnaCdZZmYxm7D2JqrrWWWp7yuedOioq2nm2K0psCMmqmrnaOpsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cody-simpson.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the Forme Boyfriend Of Miley Cyrus, Cody Simpson Dating?
