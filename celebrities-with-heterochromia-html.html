Mila Kunis</h2><p>If you take note of <a href=# rel=follow>Mila Kunis</a>'s&nbsp;eyes properly, her left eye is darker than her right.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She was <a href=# rel="follow noopener">blind in one eye</a>&nbsp;due to chronic inflammation of the iris for&nbsp;many years and kept it a secret.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Fortunately, she could reverse it through surgery. She got her vision back, but the color difference has lasted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>2. Kate Bosworth</h2><p>Perhaps the most famous star with heterochromia is&nbsp;Superman&nbsp;actress <a href=# rel=follow>Kate Bosworth</a>. Her left eye is blue, while her right one is mostly hazel.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For the longest time, fans did not know about her mismatched eyes because movie directors asked her to wear contacts.&nbsp;But for the Superman movie, the director encouraged her to let her natural features shine.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>3. Henry Cavill</h2><p>Years after Bosworth’s Superman movie was released, <a href=# rel=follow>Henry Cavill</a> replaced Brandon Rought as the new superhero. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And fans could not help but wonder if casting Cavill, who has heterochromia, was a strategic move.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Cavill’s eyes are mostly blue, but upon closer look, you will notice specks of brown in his left eye.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. Alice Eve</h2><p>Star Trek&nbsp;actress Alice Eve has some of the prettiest eyes in Hollywood, making it even more alluring with the mismatched color.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her left eye is blue, while her right is green. During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with&nbsp;Conan O’Brien, she revealed one of her boyfriends took nine months to notice the difference.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>5. Jane Seymour</h2><p>While watching&nbsp;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, you probably did not notice Jane Seymour’s heterochromia because she enraptured you with her acting.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Jane Seymour at the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award Gala.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The former Bond girl’s right eye is brown while her left one is green.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>6. Kiefer Sutherland</h2><p>Forsaken&nbsp;star Kiefer Sutherland is another celebrity on our list. The difference in his eye color is subtle, with one slightly dark than the other.&nbsp;</p><p>While he has never spoken about it, his former girlfriend, <a href=# rel=follow>Julia Roberts</a>, has.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Back in the day, the duo was a couple, and during Robert's&nbsp;Golden Globe&nbsp;acceptance speech&nbsp;in 1990, she did not mention his name but thanked her “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">beautiful blue-eyed, green-eyed friend</a>” while accepting her award.</p><h2>7. Demi Moore</h2><p>Coincidentally, Sutherland’s&nbsp;Forsaken&nbsp;co-star Demi Moore also has heterochromia.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Like the actor, Moore’s mismatched eyes are a little more on the subtle side, but upon closer look, one eye is a true hazel, whereas the other is a brighter green.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>8. Jennifer Connelly</h2><p>Often mistaken as Moore, <a href=# rel=follow>Jennifer Connelly’s</a> stunning eyes might be one thing that set her apart from her lookalike.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Unlike the Forsaken star, Connelly has the same colored eyes. But hers are lighter in the center and darker around the outer iris, with flecks of gold and black.</p><h2>9. Wentworth Miller&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Wentworth Miller</a> shot to fame after&nbsp;Prison Break&nbsp;thanks to his acting chops and piercing gaze. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>His eyes have interesting colors, with some claiming it to be a combination of blue and hazel, while others say it is icy blue.&nbsp;</p><h2>10. David Bowie</h2><p>Out of all the celebrities on this list, David Bowie’s heterochromia makes for the most interesting case.&nbsp;</p><p>His condition <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">resulted&nbsp;from&nbsp;anisocoria</a>&nbsp;caused by an injury during his youth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;And because of that, his pupils were of different sizes, leaving one eye looking darker and significantly different from the other.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuVobKjvsitoJ6rXay2tbSMoZytnaKksKm%2BzqagmmaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./penelope-cruz-cannes.html><span>←</span><span>Cannes 2011: 'Pirates' crew sail into town and Penelope goes for the chop</span></a>
