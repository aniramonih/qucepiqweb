We wanted to just flip a fun song from back in the day, I just can’t believe how far the song has gone,” she gushed while thanking her fans.</p><p>Guetta shared his acceptance speech from another location. “Thank you so, so much. This is incredible,” he said. “Bebe, I love you. Thank you for being a part of my life. I think we bring luck to each other. I’m so proud of you. I saw you starting as a songwriter to being a superstar right now.”</p><p>Rexha and Guetta <a href=#>wrote “I’m Good (Blue)” in 2017</a> but initially shelved the track. Years later, she was surprised to hear a bootleg version of the recording on social media. “I was just scrolling on TikTok and I heard a girl singing on a remix of ‘Blue,’” she told <a href=#>Variety</a> in October 2022, referring to Eiffel 65’s 1998 song “Blue (Da Ba Dee)” that inspired her collaboration with Guetta. “I was like, ‘Damn, David and I had an idea to do that back in the day.’”</p><p>Rexha only later realized, after sending the video to her social media manager, that she was <a href=#>listening to her own song</a>. “I go to YouTube and it has 30 million views,” she recalled. “I was told it pops up on YouTube every year, goes viral and then gets pulled down.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bebe-Rexha-David-Guetta-Perform-at-2023-Billboard-Music-Awards-2.jpg><p>When Rexha discovered the unreleased song’s popularity, she rerecorded her vocals and encouraged Guetta to finish producing it so they could drop the official rendition. Upon its release, the track became a chart-topping hit. “It’s incredible,” Guetta said. “It’s refreshing that we are living in a time when really people are choosing what they want to listen to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for the reason behind the song’s success, Rexha pointed to the familiarity of its sound. “People love nostalgia and the ‘00s are back in full force when it comes to fashion and music,” she explained. “I also think people have been cooped up for three years and <a href=#>they just want to be happy</a> and feel good.”</p><p>Guetta, meanwhile, believed the answer was less complicated. “Sometimes when you manage to express a simple emotion, people really relate to that,” he noted. “Doing something simple that doesn’t feel cheesy is very difficult. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. But this time it worked better than we could ever imagine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmempViv6bEx5pkqZ2im7yzudJmmK1lYmV%2FdHnBoqOlmp%2BWv6V5zK6qoptdlsSivsOsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./auburn-shooting-watch-the-moment-figure-sets-fire-to-getaway-car-used-to-take-down-tarek-zahed.html><span>←</span><span>Auburn shooting: Watch the moment figure sets fire to getaway car used to take down Tarek Zahed</span></a>
