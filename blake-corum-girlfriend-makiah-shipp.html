Born on August 21, 2002, Makiah resides in Detroit, Michigan, with her family. She is a youth advocate, political activist, social justice activist, author, and podcast host. Despite her relatively small following of 3.5k on Instagram, her verified account highlights her significant impact behind the scenes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Early_Life_and_Education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></span></h3><p>Makiah Shipp was raised by her single mother, Mauretta Andrews. Life was challenging for them as her mother was handicapped and had to care for Makiah and her two older siblings. However, these obstacles didn’t break Makiah; instead, they fueled her determination to achieve great things.</p><p>Makiah Shipp has always been an inspiring student. She completed her schooling at Detroit Edison Public School Academy, where she held the title of class president. Once, when her classmates couldn’t afford a field trip, Makiah, in her capacity as class president, negotiated a better deal with the travel agents. However, the COVID-19 pandemic ruined Shipp’s senior year and the trip. Consequently, she and her mother had to move in with her grandfather, Leonard Holmes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Career_and_Interests><strong>Career and Interests</strong></span></h3><p>After graduation, Makiah did a research internship at the U-M School of Education in 2019, which helped her earn a scholarship from the University of Michigan. After enrolling at the University of Michigan in 2020, she chose social work as her major and earned three more private scholarships. She worked as a research assistant at the University of Michigan Center for Social Solutions in 2022. She is expected to receive her Bachelor’s degree in public policy analysis in 2024.</p><p>From as far back as she can remember, Makiah has harbored a deep passion for social justice. Her outstanding efforts earned recognition from the city of Detroit at an early age. Makiah is actively involved with organizations such as the Rhonda Walker Foundation and Midnight Golf. Additionally, she is the author of a children’s book titled ‘Makiah’s Show and Tell’ and contributes as a political analyst, podcaster, and writer for the Black Student Union’s Spectrum magazine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_did_Blake_Corum_and_Makiah_Shipp_meet><strong>How did Blake Corum and Makiah Shipp meet?</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Makiah-Shipp-Blake-Corums-girlfriend-cheering-for-him-in-the-stadium.jpg><p>Makiah Shipp has been a student at Michigan University since 2020.
