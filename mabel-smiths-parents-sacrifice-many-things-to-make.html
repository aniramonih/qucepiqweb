He once belonged to both the Bishop’s Stortford Musical Theater Society and the “Cantate Youth Choir.”</p><p>The majority of people are unaware of the fact that Sam’s current notoriety is solely a result of his parent’s love and support for his singing career.</p><p>Sam was singing “My love is your love” by Whitney Houston when he was eight years old, and he was doing it in the backseat of his parent’s car.
