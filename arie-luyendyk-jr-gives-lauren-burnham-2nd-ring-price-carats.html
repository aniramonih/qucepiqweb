The massive oval-cut diamond sits atop a pavé diamond band. According to <a href=#>The Diamond Pro</a>, the sparkler is “at least” eight carats in weight and costs around $350,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/All-Details-Lauren-Burnham-Crazy-Big-2nd-Engagement-Ring-0002.jpeg><p class=p1>To no surprise, the 29-year-old Shades of Rose designer was completely shocked by the enormity of her new ring. “[The ring is], like, crazy big. I don’t know what to do with it. I’m scared. It’s so pretty. You did so good, babe. You’re so sweet,” she said in the video.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Luyendyk Jr. asked his wife for her hand — for the second time — at Nakalele Blowhole, where they first took their engagement photos. “This is a special place for us,” he said in the video. “I think it was cool.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The pair first got engaged in 2018 on The Bachelor: After the Final Rose episode. At the time, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the bauble was just over 3.6 carats. It featured a cushion-cut center stone surrounded by a diamond halo.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I made some bad decisions, but the best decision was running back to you. I can’t imagine a life without you,” Luyendyk Jr., who previously proposed to <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a>, said during his proposal. “You have shown me a love that is patient, a love that is kind, and I truly believe you are my soulmate. I’m ready to face this life with you and all that comes with it … the good and the bad. I love you so much.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The couple went on to tie the knot in January 2019 in Hawaii, where they now have a vacation home. Fast forward to May of that same year, and they welcomed daughter Alessi, who is now two years old. In June, they expanded their family, <a href=#>welcoming twins Senna and Lux</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a%2FqrGMpayynZ6Zxqx5yatkoKGmmsBuuMCuqZ6mXZfCs7rHmqRmap6ZerO1zaBkqaqZmLJur8CrmK2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-rich-dollaz-and-mariahlynn-still-together-in-2022-here-is-an-update-on-the-marriage-boot-camp-couple.html><span>←</span><span>Are Rich Dollaz and Mariahlynn Still Together In 2022?
