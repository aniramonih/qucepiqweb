This honour was proof of her extraordinary talent and service to the television industry.</p><p>Gibson was born on June 19, 2004, in Greater Manchester. Her path to acting was shaped by a memorable event that occurred in her early years. She was resilient even as a young child, as evidenced by the scar on her right eyebrow after a fall down stairs.</p><p>Originating from the quaint Tameside town of Broadbottom, Gibson attended the Blue Coat School in Oldham for her education. Her enthusiasm for performing started to develop around this time. She found that taking acting training at the Oldham Theatre Workshop was a crucial move towards her future profession. She was noticed by Scream Management, a well-known talent agency in Manchester Media City, who took her under their care after realising her potential.</p><p>In 2017, Amelia Eve Gibson debuted as an actress when she signed on to play Indira Cave in the CBBC series Jamie Johnson. Because of her remarkable performance in the first series, she was chosen for the second and third, showcasing her acting abilities in 17 episodes overall.</p><p>In November 2017, Gibson continued to broaden her career as she made a cameo as Mia in the third episode of the BBC One drama series Love, Lies, and Records. Her prominence on television was further cemented by this exposure. She showed off her acting prowess in October 2018 when she was cast in a major role in the three-part ITV drama series Butterfly as Lily Duffy.</p><p>In June of 2019, Gibson made her debut as Kelly Neelan on the popular ITV serial series Coronation Street, which marked a turning point in her career. Her outstanding performance earned her a comeback as a regular character in April 2020 after she first appeared in five episodes.</p><p>During this period, she received critical praise for her performance as Kelly Neelan, which led to her winning the coveted Best Young Actor prize at the 2022 British Soap Awards. She was nominated for Best Actress at the Inside Soap Awards later that year, demonstrating that her talent was not unheard of.</p><h2 id=h-millie-gibson-age class=wp-block-heading><strong>Millie Gibson Age</strong></h2><p>Gibson is currently 19 years old and was born in Greater Manchester on June 19, 2004.</p><span class=td-adspot-title>- Advertisement -</span><h2 id=h-millie-gibson-net-worth class=wp-block-heading><strong>Millie Gibson’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Actress Millie Gibson is reportedly worth between $1 and $2 million USD (approximately) at this point in her career.</p><h2 id=h-millie-gibson-boyfriend class=wp-block-heading><strong>Millie Gibson Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>Actress Millie Gibson’s boyfriend is reportedly Tom Neatis.
