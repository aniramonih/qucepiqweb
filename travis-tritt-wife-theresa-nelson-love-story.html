At the time, Tritt was a ‘rowdy outlaw, hell-bent-for-leather guy’ who lived up to image as the country’s bad boy. He had also made up his mind that he was going to be a bachelor for life. And so it came as a surprise to many and even himself when he fell in love again after two failed marriages and settled down.&nbsp;</p><p>But that is love, and today, the couple celebrates a twenty-four-year strong love with their three kids. So, let’s take a look back to how it all started and see how love found its way to them.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>First Chapter: ‘More Than You’ll Ever Know’</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Travis Tritt (@realtravistritt)</a></p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>Here Are Ten Travis Tritt Songs You Should Listen Right Now</a></p><p>Before Theresa Nelson, <a href=#>Travis Tritt</a> had already been married twice – first, to his high school sweetheart named Karen Ryon and then later on to Jodi Barnett, who was twelve years his senior – and at that point, he figured that marriage wasn’t his thing. In an interview with Country Weekly in 2000, he also revealed that he and <a href=#>Marty Stuart</a>, longtime friend and collaborator, had a pep talk about it, and they agreed that they were better off staying single. And he became that guy who was known for having a penchant for sleeping around.</p><p>But fate had something in store for Tritt, and what he thought couldn’t find his way back to him again did so, and in a way, he didn’t expect.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 8, 1995, Tritt celebrated his birthday at a Nashville restaurant with friend and country music legend Marty Stuart. And one girl from the crowd struck out to him. It was Theresa Nelson, a college student and model. According to Tritt, he saw a sincere sweetness in her that stood out from all the other women he had ever met. As he said, he was no dummy, so he got her phone number and started calling her, and feelings soon developed.&nbsp;</p><p>At the start of their relationship, the two spent every waking moment with each other for about three to four months. But they had to be apart for two weeks after that, and worse, they had no means of communication as Tritt’s cell phone signal was not working in the area. He missed her so much, and he felt miserable during that time.&nbsp;</p><p>That was then he wrote his top 5 hit, “More Than You’ll Ever Know,” as a confession of his love to Nelson. The two finally got back together when Nelson moved to Atlanta to be with him. And then on April 12, 1997, the couple tied the knot.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Travis Tritt’s wife, Theresa Nelson?</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Travis Tritt (@realtravistritt)</a></p><p><a href=#>Theresa Nelson</a> was born on July 12, 1972 and is currently 49 years old. And just like many non-celebrity partners, there is hardly any information about Nelson’s family or life before she met the country music singer. Except that she was voted as 1989 Miss Leesburg, which was revealed by her daughter Tyler Reese Tritt in an interview with Lake and Summer Style in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>What we also do know now is that she was a college student and model when she and Travis Tritt first met. She is his third wife and the mother of his three beautiful children. Indeed for the singer, the third time was the charm.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Second Chapter: Meet Travis Tritt’s Children</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Travis Tritt (@realtravistritt)</a></p><p>The couple had three beautiful children – the eldest, Tyler Reese (1998), followed by Tristan James (1999), and then Tarian Nathaniel (2003).&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, growing up in a house with a country music star, it’s inevitable that someone will eventually follow in his footsteps. True enough, Tyler Reese showed a passion and talent for singing at a very early age. She often joined his father on stage, delivering a vocal talent that she surely inherited from her father. In fact, she has already received offers from Disney and Nickelodeon to do shows, but Travis wouldn’t let her do it. He knew that if she was already talented at that point, then she would even get better as she got older.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, the two recorded a duet cover of Don Henley and Patty Smyth’s <a href=#>“Sometimes Love Just Ain’t Enough,”</a> and as expected, it was amazing. The duet was part of Tritt’s re-release of his 2007 album&nbsp;The Storm&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Calm After</a>.&nbsp;And then in 2015, Tyler revealed her plans to really follow in her father’s footsteps and become a country singer. Music meant everything to her because it was all she has ever known. Two years later, she was opening for her father’s tour all over the country, and soon after, she released her debut single “Perfect,” written by Jesse Owen Astin, Adam Folsom, and Dionne Osborne.&nbsp;</p><p>But aside from Tyler, Tristan also inherited the musical genes. And just this 2021, he performed with his band Pale Moon Creek on the final day of a seafood festival in Powder Springs alongside Otis Redding III, Sonny Emory, Paula Abdul, Eric Clapton, Jennifer Lopez, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>As of the moment, there is no news about the youngest, Tarian Nathaniel. But it wouldn’t be surprising if we see him on stage one of these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Travis Tritt and wife Theresa Nelson are spending the best days of their lives with each other. As Nelson said, they are best friends, and that’s why they can do everything together without getting sick of each other.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursaSdrq%2Bzw5qgpbFemLyue9OrmK%2Bho2LBs7XTrWSwoZaaerW0xKucrJldo7Ktv86nZKWnppp6tMDOq7Bo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hollander.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hollander Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family, and More</span></a>
