In an interview with Grazia, she said: "I worked so hard to get all the money I could and I feel like I can spend it any way I want. If it makes me feel better I don’t know why that’s seen as a negative thing?"</p><p id=eSXC8PERD71t data-wc=35>But Megan wasn't unhappy with the way she looked before, saying: "I was still beautiful in my own way back then, I’ve just changed a few things. I was comfortable then and I’m comfortable now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/240ffe6eacd2-megan-z.jpg><p id=eYNiLuVBijkB data-wc=4><strong>Meghan in August 2019</strong></p><p id=eP5wfjf3E1ZR data-wc=47>During her appearance on the Victoria Derbyshire show in April 2019, Megan revealed: "I had procedures done solely for me and my first was at 17, I had my ears pinned back. Then at 19, I had a boob job and rhinoplasty. It was all for me…</p><p id=e9nzcNDIkYep data-wc=20>"Then when I was on TV, everyone were like 'this is her before, this is her after. She's so fake!'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd36962cee20-megan-barton-hanson-before-love-island-z.jpg><p id=es12H4OYWh0U data-wc=6><strong>Megan, aged 18, out with friends</strong></p><p id=eJk7BqkfXAJ0 data-wc=39>Despite telling fans that she didn’t feel insecure about the way that she looked, Megan would go on to tell Victoria that she needed to work on herself because going under the knife "didn’t fix all of my problems."</p><p id=erBbWZMR8RH1 data-wc=58>In 2019, Megan joined Isle of Paradise's 'Get Body Posi' campaign and handbook, a global commitment to making body acceptance top of the beauty industry agenda in 2019 and beyond. Founder Jules Von Hep rallied the likes of Tess Holliday, Danielle Peazer, Tess Daly and HELLO!’s very own Alex Light to tackle the body positivity and acceptance struggles.</p><p id=ebl-64iga6MN data-wc=89>Megan said: "Everyone struggles with some aspect of themselves. I was that geeky teen and I didn’t like much about myself. I’ve been working to change that and accept myself. Insecurity stems from us trying to achieve the unachievable, looking or dressing a way that’s trendy that month. Learning to focus and rock your own vibe is the most liberating thing any one of us can do. This is what this campaign is about and I am committed to help change the way we view beauty as a society."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b8bf6c8e604f-megan-before-love-island-z.jpg><p id=eGCzR-eZNpyY data-wc=3><strong>Meghan, aged 18</strong></p><p id=eXmNSYsHhwlP data-wc=84>Megan says she is a feminist, although she has faced criticism because of her work as a stripper and for the cosmetic surgery. But she doesn't care about the criticism, telling Fabulous: "As long as you empower women and support what women do with their bodies, that’s a feminist as far as I’m concerned. If someone never wants to get surgery or shave their armpits, that’s fine. If I wanna go out and spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on surgery, that’s also fine.”</p><p id=eMavGMNfNYQP data-wc=1><strong>SHOP:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Looking for the best fake tan?
