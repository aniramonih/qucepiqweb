The Cuban influencer shares a photo of her swimsuit style in one of her latest posts. "Find the two mistakes," she captioned the photo of herself, taken on the beach in Dubai. How does she stay so fit?

She recently posted </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this video and photo</span></a><span> together of herself doing a boxing session at her gym with a trainer. She captioned the post, "It's my first time, no technique, no practice. But write down the date… because I am crushing!!!" Boxing has many health benefits, "because it constantly requires you to think, change your position, and change your posture," physical therapist Linda Arslanian, director of rehabilitation services at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's hospital tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>."You're swinging your arms, moving the muscles of your arms and shoulders, increasing your upper-body strength. And when you're in the boxer crouch with a wide stance, with your knees slightly bent, you're strengthening your core muscles, back, and legs."</span></p><p><span>Ulloa clearly does her fair share of exercise. Her workout of choice? Strength training. "I have an exercise routine to keep fit. Every morning, five days a week, I go to the gym, which I love to do," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cuba Cute</span></a><span>. She posts several different videos on Instagram of herself doing weight training with her trainer and at the gym. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In this reel,</span></a><span> she is seen doing lateral pulldowns, captioning it, "My coach says that I must exceed my limits."</span></p><p><span>Ulloa describes horseback riding as&nbsp; "One of my many passions." She posted </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this series of photos</span></a><span> of herself riding on the beach in the Dominican Republic. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>American Heart Association</span></a><span>, riding horses is great for your health. Not only does it boost cardiovascular health, but builds core strength, burns calories, and lowers blood pressure. It is also great for your mental health as it helps relax you.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Imaray knows that there is no shortcut to health. One of the things you can't cheat on is your diet. "I also eat a healthy and balanced diet that allowed me to reach the size XS that I am today," she told Cuba Cutie.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Imaray also goes for regular runs. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, running is great for cardiovascular health, muscle building, and weight loss. "For every mile run, the average person will burn approximately 100 calories," they say.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoqWRp666edSlo6iZXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102aqmrGjYrOqusNmq6GdXanEsHnMoqqtmZuawHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-pronounce-titular.html><span>←</span><span>How to pronounce titular</span></a>
