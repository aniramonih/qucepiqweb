Hailie Engesser, a 9th grader and a friend of Kuch, told the board about the existing bullying culture that has been prevalent at the school for quite some time now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Then there was this and the tragic beating which lead to suicide of NJ high school student Adriana Kuch ()</p>— Michael Weaver (@MichaelGWeaver) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>“It’s actually really, really hard "</h2><p>“It’s actually really, really hard to be going to school because of and everything that’s been going on,” she said according to . “I’m still grieving over Adriana.

I’m used to it,” he said. Velez said the officials were “swept under the rug" despite reporting about the incidents several times in the past. Another student Echo McNichols came forward with her version of bullying of being followed around the school track. She said when she was with her sister, "they told me I was ugly and fat and that I should kill myself, they sent us pictures of guns and told us they knew where we lived and they were going to send people to our house to come rape us," according to .&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Fourteen-year-old Adriana Kuch took her own life the day after a video was posted online of her being savagely beaten by bullies at school.</p>— Inside Edition (@InsideEdition) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>“I know multiple people who’ve been sexually assaulted at this school and … the school just does not care. And this proves that you guys do not care, because I have made multiple reports to the school, to guidance, to the office, to everywhere, and it’s just been ignored and swept under the rug, and we’re tired of that,” Velez continued. “When people ask me what my experience at Central Regional is, it’s not, ‘I went to CR.’ It’s ‘I survived CR,’ because coming to the school, it’s like being in a prison.”&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>14 year old Adriana Olivia Kuch killed herself on Feb. 3, days after a video of her being attacked by four classmates spread around Central Regional High School in Bayville,</p><p>Full Video uploaded on the Link below</p>— Rasheed malik (@Rasheed46453308) <a href=#>February 10, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>Another victim, Junior Milo Luga said that she gets harassed “every day” since seventh grade because she is gay and disclosed that the bullies had posted her photo on social media. “I’ve been to mental hospitals, and I’ve been suicidal, and I’ve self-harmed in the past because of what happened to me in the school,” she said.&nbsp; Luga claimed that her mother has informed the school “on so many occasions” and spoken to “everyone single person you can think of,” including the superintendent, but “was never given any genuine help.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Happening now - board meeting moments from starting at Central Regional - many expected to express outrage over the bullying and suicide of Adriana Kuch</p>— Jim Murdoch (@ReporterJim) <a href=#>February 16, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve just been told to ignore it, to be the bigger person, walk away,” she said, adding that the bullies have never been punished strictly for their actions. “The people who have made fun of me are still here. I don’t know what happened to them. They can’t tell me.”</p><p>The meeting reportedly began with a moment of silence for the teenager who committed suicide on February 3. The rowdy crowd voiced their anger at the board as they moved through regular business. “We don’t care about your agenda, we want to get to what we’re all here for!” one woman screamed.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The attacker of Adriana Kuch is named Ayonna Lanzetti!

She said that her niece had to leave the school because she was getting bullied badly every day. “It shouldn’t take a child taking her own life for us to change. It should never get to that point,” she said. “A child should never have those thoughts. A child should be able to enter a school and feel safe. We should be teaching our children tolerance and love and respect. Everybody’s different.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Adriana Kuch living her best life and feeding a giraffe. Her laugh breaks my heart.

Why are you being silent?” “Why am I hearing that the policy hasn’t changed in 30 years? Students that were bullied 30 years ago, and it’s still the same today,” she continued, to loud applause from the audience.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>No wonder Ayona Lanzetti is a bully.

Based on our data alone it doesn’t indicate that we’re a culture of violence. We don’t condone that. We actually do everything in our power to dissuade that. I don’t want to argue with parents that I’ve never had a productive and positive conversation with but no I’m sorry I don’t agree that we have a culture of violence.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKGYoqSZmnqmusaeqqydomKupb7ImqWaZZuqsKm%2FjJ%2Bpop2emXq0rdisZKybmKS8rXnCqKylnF2drrexjKmpnq6Vo8GmsIyhnKtllJqutbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./goo-ha-ra.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Ha-Ra Goo dating?
