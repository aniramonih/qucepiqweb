Here's where Carrie Underwood stands alone. As of 2019, <a href=#>The Tennessean</a> reported that the "American Idol" alum had hosted the Country Music Awards for the past 12 years before she passed the torch. Along with pulling hosting duties for over a decade, <a href=#>Underwood is known for rocking stunning outfits on-stage</a>. From sparkly minidresses, to feathers, to dramatic ball gowns, there's nothing that the country crooner can't pull off. And we haven't even mentioned her <a href=#>catalogue of accolades</a>, including the multitude of Grammys, ACM Awards, CMT Music Awards, and more ...</p><p dir=ltr>Of course, when we're talking about successful country music artists, we have to bring up Taylor Swift. Though the "Blank Space" singer made the crossover into the pop genre earlier in her career, she's still seen as a country darling. Swift is also one of the most decorated musicians of all time, and "is the first and only woman solo artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year" thrice," per <a href=#>Grammy.com</a>.</p><p>Another thing Swift is known for is her feuds. This star has had <a href=#>"Bad Blood"</a> with plenty of others in the entertainment industry, <a href=#>including</a> Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, and reportedly, even Underwood. So, why don't the country titans see eye-to-eye?</p><h2>Carrie Underwood made fun of Taylor Swift's relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/inside-the-rumored-drama-between-carrie-underwood-and-taylor-swift/carrie-underwood-made-fun-of-taylor-swifts-relationships-1662234639.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Kathy Hutchins & Kathy Hutchins/Shutterstock</span><p dir=ltr>The alleged feud between Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift dates back to 2011, when CMA co-hosts Brad Paisley and Underwood poked fun at <a href=#>Kim Kardashian's 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries</a>, plus Swift's infamously short-lived relationships. "I'm going to love you forever, or 72 days ... as long as Taylor Swift is with her current boyfriend," they sang (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>The following year, Swift was once again fair game at the CMAs after breaking up with her then-boyfriend, Connor Kennedy. "The greatest trade of the year had to be the Kennedy family. They somehow traded Arnold Schwarzenegger for Taylor Swift," Paisley joked (via the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>). When he wondered aloud whether they were going to get back together, Underwood referenced Swift's No. 1 hit single, <a href=#>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together."</a> "Never, never never. Never ever," she replied. Things were frosty enough between both Swift and Underwood that they <a href=#>requested to be seated away</a> from each other at the 2013 Grammy Awards.</p><p>Underwood remained dismissive of Swift's boyfriends, even years later. In 2016, An insider speaking to Radar Online that year (via&nbsp;<a href=#>OK! Magazine</a>) claimed&nbsp;the "Dirty Laundry" singer had referred to <a href=#>Swift's romance with DJ Calvin Harris</a> as a "faux-mance." "Things have become icier than ever between them because Taylor overheard back-stabbing snickers that Carrie disrespected Calvin ... Normally, Taylor wouldn't care too much about backstage babble. But Carrie really rubs her the wrong way," the insider added.</p><h2>Carrie Underwood denied rumors of a rift with Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/inside-the-rumored-drama-between-carrie-underwood-and-taylor-swift/carrie-underwood-denied-rumors-of-a-rift-with-taylor-swift-1662234639.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Jason Kempin/Getty Images</span><p dir=ltr>Though many speculated about Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood" with Carrie Underwood, Underwood maintained they didn't have any kind of relationship. "I'm not close to [Swift]. We run into each other at events. We're never in the same place at the same time," she told <a href=#>Radar Online</a> in 2013. The country crooner also shot down reports of a feud when she sat down with Gayle King for a "CBS This Morning" interview (via <a href=#>Taste of Country</a>). "In every magazine, in pretty much every newspaper or on gossip TV shows, they can just get away with it by saying 'a source said' or an 'insider said,'" Underwood explained. "I've read the most ridiculous things about myself when people do that."</p><p dir=ltr>In fact, Underwood seemed keen to put the rumors to bed. In the same "CBS" interview, she praised Swift for her willingness to experiment musically. "I really like, <a href=#>'I Knew You Were Trouble,'</a>" she said. "It sounded a lot different for [Swift]. I liked the branching out. She's trying some different sounds." And, in June, Underwood featured Swift's "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" in a game of song association for <a href=#>ELLE Magazine</a>.</p><p>Swift hasn't weighed in much on the perceived drama, but she did hint that Underwood hurt her feelings with that CMAs jab. In 2012, she told <a href=#>The New York Times Magazine</a> that viewers didn't see her reaction, because "[The cameras] don't pan to you if you're not laughing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnFjZoZ3e8inqqKclWLBqbGMq6ymp6KasW6w0ZqkmmWSmsG4scSnZJyZoqe2pnnUp5ueqqekvKV5wKebZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christie-hefner.html><span>←</span><span>Hugh Hefner's Daughter, Christie Hefner Stayed In A Marital Relationship From 1995 To 2013.
