"I did, yes," he responded, regarding his call with Craig.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We had known each other many, many years," Law recalled. "So the conversation took on all sorts of turns."</p><p>It was also revealed that during the phone call, Law told Craig to fess up about the affair to then-girlfriend, producer <strong>Satsuki Mitchell</strong>, whom Craig later got engaged to in 2007. When his relationship with Mitchell ended, Craig quickly moved on and married his Dream House costar <strong><a href=#>Rachel Weisz</a></strong> in 2011.</p><p>Miller, meanwhile, married actor <strong>Tom Sturridge</strong> in 2011 and welcomed their daughter in July 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGunJViuaLDjKinnqajYsKxecCbpq6sXZazp63Iq2SbnaSssqa6jKygnqaelnqutculnKtlkaOxbrDAp6CepF2Yv6K1xmZpaWlkZ4Ry</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-farro-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Farro Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
