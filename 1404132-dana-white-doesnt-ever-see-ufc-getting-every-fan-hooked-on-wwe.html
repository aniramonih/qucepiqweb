Dana White took part in a media scrum last night. When asked about UFC’s Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Lawrence Epstein’s comments about turning every WWE fan into a UFC fan and every UFC fan into a WWE fan, White didn’t mix words with his blunt response. “Lawrence, I love you. One of the dumbest statements of all time,” Dana White said."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

One of the dumbest statements of all time,” Dana White said. “Yeah, I don’t know why he said that. I don’t even know what to say that. No, there’s no — there’s some crossover. Some people like WWE, some people like UFC. Some people like both.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s ever going to be a day where we turn every UFC fan into a WWE fan or every WWE fan — what’s beautiful about the synergy between these two fan bases is they are very completely opposite. There’s very little crossover. And again, maybe he was misquoted. I hope that’s the case. Because I could not disagree with him more.”</p><p><a href=#>Nick Khan Talks UFC Fighters Potentially Having A ‘Longer Life’ With WWE</a></p><p>What do you make of Dana White’s comments?
