And start rooting for her to finally get that elusive Emmy — or maybe multiples, depending on when the new show debuts as the second half of Better Call Saul will be eligible for awards next year, too."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The duo is teaming up for a new series that’s already been given the go-ahead for two full seasons before it’s even begun shooting.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>“After 15 years, I figured it was time to take a break from writing antiheroes… and who’s more heroic than the brilliant Rhea Seehorn?” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilligan told Deadline.</a> “It’s long past time she had her own show, and I feel lucky to get to work on it with her.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>While Gilligan will be the, as of now, untitled show’s executive producer and showrunner, he’ll also be reuniting with Diane Mercer, who worked on all three of Breaking Bad, El Camino, and Better Call Saul.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>On top of that, Gilligan is teaming up with several more folks he made magic with in the past, including Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, who helped sell both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, something Gilligan was extremely ecstatic about.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>“And what nice symmetry to be reunited with Zack Van Amburg, Jamie Erlicht and Chris Parnell! Jamie and Zack were the first two people to say yes to&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;all those years ago. They’ve built a great team at Apple, and my wonderful, longtime partners at Sony Pictures Television and I are excited to be in business with them,” he said.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Details of the show are still a bit shrouded in mystery, which is fitting since reports have it linked to The Twilight Zone in its vibe and world-building, “bending reality and focusing on people and exploring the human condition in an unexpected, surprising way,” according to Deadline. So perhaps Gilligan is returning to his supernatural roots as an X-Files writer.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=false>You can catch more Seehorn in the current short-form digital series, Cooper’s Bar, which she directed and executive produced while also garnering some great reviews itself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yztMSaZKydlZ28s7qMraZmq6SWv261zWalnq9dq7avr8RmnqKknJ60orqMrJyroZWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betnijah-laney.html><span>←</span><span>Betnijah Laney biografa, edad, altura, esposa, net worth, familia</span></a>
