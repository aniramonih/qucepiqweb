Now, we've got a few more photos from the partnership, which bridges Jolie's signature minimal and stealthy style with Chloé's feminine DNA and its commitment to the environment and the supply chain.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy ChloÃ©</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Fusing fluid, feminine silhouettes with graceful fabrics, the eveningwear-focused collection has a timeless appeal that serves a deeper purpose: celebrating authentic women-to-women connections," according to a press release from Chloé. The announcement also noted that Jolie's collection incorporates deadstock and natural fabrics, like organic silk and organic crepe de chine as well as certified wool.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ZoÃ« Ghertner</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ZoÃ« Ghertner</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The collection also comprises at least 80% lower-impact materials, which puts it head and shoulders above any other brands that are making headway in environmentalism. Another way that the Chloé x Atelier Jolie partnership stands apart from other sustainable efforts is its use of special manufacturing partnerships. The collection pulled in artisans from Akanjo, a World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) social enterprise based in Madagascar that trains and promotes craftspeople, and Paris's La Fabrique Nomade, which pushes for professional inclusion for refugee and migrant artisans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first looks from the brand include a dramatic black velvet cape and a sleek white gown made of deadstock micro silk. Jolie's team also remixed Chloé classics like the lavallière shirt. Of course, there are accessories on offer, too.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jolie pledged that all of her proceeds from this collaboration would be put back into the manufacturing cycle and to establish apprenticeships for refugees and other underrepresented groups at Atelier Jolie. The collection will be available to shop at Chloé boutiques and at Chloe.com in Jan. 2024.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Previously</a>, Jolie spoke about how her daughter, Zahara, inspired her to add more colors to her collection to better reflect the skin tones of her customers.
