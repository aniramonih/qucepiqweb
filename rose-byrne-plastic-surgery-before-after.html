Afterwards, she landed roles on a couple of television shows. Her next film role came when she was around 20 in the movie Two Hands where she worked with the now late actor Heath Ledger. In 2000, she got her break after starring in another Australian movie <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Goddess of 1967</a>, which earned her a Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebritysizes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rose-Byrne-3-189x300.jpg alt="Rose Byrne " width=189 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>This milestone in her career led her to go to Hollywood for more international opportunities. At first, she played small roles in such film as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and while still working with a few Australian movies. In 2004, she gained recognition for her portrayal of Briseis in the box office hit <a href=# rel=nofollow>Troy</a>. This was followed by the films Wicker Park, The Tenants, and Marie Antoinette.</p><p>In the late 2000s, she’s had notable roles in such movies as <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sunshine</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>28 Weeks Later</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Knowing</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Adam</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Get Him to the Greek</a>. It was, however, in 2011 that she’s had major successes with her roles in the films <a href=# rel=nofollow>Insidious</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bridesmaids</a>. Around the same time, she portrayed Moira MacTaggert in <a href=# rel=nofollow>X-Men: First Class</a>. She went on to take comedic roles in the comedy films I Give It a Year and The Internship.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>In 2013, she reprised her role as Renai Lambert in Insidious: Chapter 2 and starred in the comedies Adult Beginners and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Neighbors</a>. She’s had two films in 2014 – This Is Where I Leave You and Annie. She also recently starred in the 2015 action-comedy film <a href=# rel=nofollow>Spy</a>. She will reprise her roles in X-Men: Apocalypse and Neighbors 2, which will be released in 2016. Byrne is also best known for her role as Ellen Parsons on the television series <a href=# rel=nofollow>Damages</a>.</p><p><strong>Has Rose Byrne had Plastic Surgery?</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebritysizes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rose-Byrne-4-199x300.jpg alt="Rose Byrne " width=199 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Aussie beauty has established her career in Hollywood through hard work and her natural charm on screen. She has been in horror, drama, and comedy films and was able to deliver fine performances in all of them, proving her versatility as an actress. Despite her massive talent in performing, Rose is no exception when it comes to people scrutinizing her physical appearance. For one, she’s often rumored of having an eating disorder because of her very slim figure, but the actress has since denied such reports.</p><p>Also, the Insidious actress has been reported to undergoing cosmetic procedures at one point of her Hollywood career, too, using her improved looks as the basis for such claims. A rhinoplasty procedure is one possibility, considering her nose has gone from average to looking slimmer and being more well-defined. And since the actress is not getting any younger (she’s 36 this year), there have been talks of Botox injections on her part as well. How else could she have a flawless face with few to almost zero wrinkles considering she’s nearing her 40s?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3 class=related_post_title>Related Posts</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwKrGxKxlnKedZL%2Bwv8RmmbKqnpp6sbjArKuim12owrOzxKuwZpqVm7yzsYyana2domQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roman-polanski-thought-bruce-lee-may-have-killed-sharon-tate-304417.html><span>←</span><span>Roman Polanski Thought Bruce Lee May Have Killed Sharon Tate</span></a>
