Her wife is best known for her work in films and on television, including “Evan Almighty”, “Rio”, “Ice Age; Continental Drift”, and “The New Adventures of Old Christine”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/db689a873d4d83ad0c5026d96e661088.jpg><h2>The Net Worth of Alex Sykes</h2><p>How rich is Alex Sykes? As of late-2018, sources inform us of a net worth that is over $1 million, earned through success in her various endeavors. Her wealth has also been elevated thanks to the success of her wife, who has a net worth estimated at $6 million. As she continues her endeavors, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2>Early Life and Before Wanda</h2><p>Very little information is known about Alex’s childhood and her life before meeting Wanda, with her early years being out of the media spotlight as she grew up in France. There is also no information available about her education. It is not known when she decided to move to the US, or about her career before she met the actress. It is also not known if she shared the same experience as Wanda, who hid her sexuality for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aa38c1d3e7410bab168bbebd0f05dcb2.jpg><h2>Wife – Wanda Sykes</h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Wanda</a> began her career as a writer, working on “The Chris Rock Show” in 1999 which earned her a Primetime Emmy Award, a comedy talk show featuring various guests and hosted by Rock for a total of five seasons. In 2004, she was considered one of the funniest people in the US, and started to appear in films, such as “Monster-in-Law” and “My Super Ex-Girlfriend”, which is a comedy film starring Uma Thurman.</p><p>var RevContentSolo = { button_text: ‘Find Out More’, widget_id: 170813};</p><p>She also had a role in the series “The New Adventures of Old Christine” for four years, the sitcom starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing a divorced mother, who maintains a close relationship with her ex-husband despite their divorce. She then ventured into voice-acting work, including animated films such as “Over the Hedge” which is based on the comic strip of the same name. She also had a voice role in “Rio”, which tells the story of a male Spix’s macaw who goes to Rio de Janeiro. Afterwards, she joined the “Ice Age” film franchise, beginning with “Ice Age: Continental Drift”. Other projects she’s worked on include “Ice Age: Collision Course” and the upcoming “UglyDolls”.</p><p>Today I am hanging out with the good folks at The Chew – check your local listing! #WhatHappenedMsSykes #EpixHD</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wanda Sykes</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Thursday, October 20, 2016</a></p><h2>Relationship and Marriage</h2><p>Alex wasn’t Wanda’s first marriage, as she was previously married to record producer Dave Hall from 1991 until their divorce in 1998. Her former husband is known for helping produce the first album of Mary J. Blige. It is not known if Wanda was already attracted to women at this point, although when she was 40 years-old she came out to her parents, who were very conservative, and which led to a period of estrangement – they even declined to attend her wedding; she had &nbsp;met Alex in 2006 she, and the two started dating.</p><p>In 2008, Wanda came out publicly as a lesbian during a same-sex marriage rally in Las Vegas regarding Proposition 8. The couple were <a rel=nofollow href=#>married</a> around this time, and a year later, Alex gave birth to a pair of fraternal twins. Sometime later, the couple reconciled with Wanda’s parents and they now have a good relationship. The family reside in Media, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and they also have a home in Los Angeles, California splitting time between both. Despite the success of her wife, Alex has managed to stay in the background, avoiding any media attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wanda-sykes-and-wife-alex1.jpg><h2>Advocacies and Recent Endeavors</h2><p>While there hasn’t been much coverage of Alex, it is known that she is very supportive of Wanda’s career, and the two have appeared in public together, such as at red carpet events. They are supporters of the legalization of same-sex marriage, having hosted events and participated in fundraisers to help promote same-sex marriage, and were very active in opposing Proposition 8 which was intended to stop the legalization of same-sex marriage in California. Wanda is also known to work with the animal organization PETA, in promoting the dog anti-chaining legislation in the state.</p><p>In 2011, Wanda appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and announced that she was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS, described as stage zero breast cancer, and though it is a non-invasive disease, she opted to have a bilateral mastectomy to help lower her chances of later suffering breast cancer.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Proud to be with <a rel=nofollow href=#>@Delta</a> employees & <a rel=nofollow href=#>@BCRFcure</a> for an event that is <a rel=nofollow href=#>#CarryingUsCloser</a> to a cure! <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/xsa3AzJTLk</a></p><p>— Wanda Sykes (@iamwandasykes) <a rel=nofollow href=#>September 28, 2016</a></p><h2>Sykes on Social Media</h2><p>One of the reasons there is very little information about Alex’s past or present endeavors is due to the lack of any online presence. She does not have accounts associated with any of the major social media websites. There are others that share the same name, but they are not related to her in any way.</p><p>The opposite is true for her wife Wanda, who is very active on Twitter and Instagram, having accounts on both, and uses her platforms to promote some of her recent and upcoming projects, including a stand-up comedy tour. She also posts a lot of personal photos and comedic content. She is known to be strongly in opposition to President Donald Trump, having made jokes about him which has caused a bit of <a rel=nofollow href=#>controversy</a> – she mentioned that she is lesbian and black, knowing that Trump has criticized both minorities.</p><p>The post <a rel=nofollow href=#>Alex Sykes: Wanda Sykes wife’s Bio: Twins, Net Worth, Family, Wiki, Kids</a> appeared first on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Affair Post</a>.</p><p>Post source: Affair Post</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqOesF2oxqyx0maumqaUlnq0xcqeqmavmZuytHnBoqZmrKeeu7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecWapKKkqWLEqrfIZqKinKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-mcarthur-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Alex McArthur Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
