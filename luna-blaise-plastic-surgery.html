She got lip fillers and heavily edits her body.”</p><p>The person added, “I’ve seen some comments about her and saying how they’re not gonna eat to get her body and I think it’s just so wrong. I think she’s very gorgeous though as I’ve watched her a lot on shows.”</p><p>Since the fans began to make negative remarks about her, others of her followers began to support her, stating that she has a life and the freedom to do anything she wants. They also said that she looked stunning with and without the lip fillers.</p><p>After the post, one social media user commented, “Prettier before. Lip fillers look ridiculous. So sad not to be happy with your natural beauty.” Some commenters also used words like “horrible and terrible” and accused her of using&nbsp;Photoshop.</p><p>At the same time, another stated, “It bugs me so much to look at her in the show now lol 😂 her face is so different, I really liked her b4 but she’s got 0 expressions right now.”</p><p>In 2021, someone asked on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> if she had lip fillers, and the majority of individuals said yes.

She also said that one of her family members died at age 25 from breast cancer and that both of her grandparents survived breast cancer.</p><p>She believed that due to the evolution of the body, breast cancer might occur at any age.&nbsp;As a result, Blaise encourages all young girls, regardless of age, to have a breast cancer screening.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luna Blaise’s height and weight</h2><p>Blaise <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stands</a> out to be 5 feet and 5 inches tall.

She gave birth to her daughter, fell in love, and got married to her current husband, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole DeBoer</a> —&nbsp; all in front of the public’s eyes.</p><p>All in all, people have seen Chelsea since she was a child and have seen her transformation to date. Comparing her before and after photos, netizens have noticed various changes in Chelsea.</p><p>From her getting a lot of tattoos to going through a massive weight loss transformation, Chelsea has transformed. However, many could not help but notice some subtle changes in the reality TV star, which could be possible only through plastic surgery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chelsea DeBoer’s plastic surgery and tattoos</h2><p>Since Chelsea has left Teen Mom 2, netizens have been speculating that she underwent plastic surgery. They mostly comment on her Instagram and TikTok posts about how she looks unrecognizable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Plastic surgeon Dr. Richard Westreich also agreed that Chelsea had gone under the knife and gave his speculation to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The U.S Sun</a>. He noted that she looked different than before because of the work she had done on her lips and chin.</p><p>He said, “The main cosmetic work she has done is her lips and chin. I think there has been some lip filler and manipulation of the chin using filler as well.” He claimed that she did not get a chin implant but used fillers to get rid of the chin cleft she had.</p><p>“Chelsea previously had a cleft in her chin, like a dimple in the middle. But from around March 2022, it’s gone. I don’t see any real clefting of her chin. She may have had filler done somewhere around there to get rid of it,” he noticed.</p><p>Throughout the years, Chelsea has undergone a massive weight loss. After giving birth to her second child, she lost 50 lbs in 2020, right before her wedding to Cole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/luna-blaise-298x400.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Chelsea DeBoer might have undergone plastic surgery. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>)</p><p>Dr. Westreich also took her weight loss transformation into consideration while speculating about the plastic surgery Chelsea might have gotten. He explained, “If Chelsea had a lot of weight loss, she may have wanted to redefine her jawline a little bit.”</p><p>“If Chelsea had a lot of weight loss, they may have put some chin filler in there,” he speculated. All in all, the plastic surgeon believed that her weight loss might have triggered her need to go under the knife.</p><p>He pointed out, “Her main changes are the weight loss, the hair, filler in the chin, and filler in the lips. She had a lot of weight loss, so it is also possible that she needed some body work.”</p><p>While taking all that into consideration, it should also be stressed that Chelsea has not explicitly admitted to getting plastic surgery. However, she has been open about getting lip fillers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In November 2022, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Instagram that she was undergoing lip fillers. She filmed herself before a cosmetic procedure and said, “It’s cold here and it’s snowing. But you know what warms me up? Warms up my little heart?”</p><p>“Getting my lips plumped up for the holidays.” “It’s just a touch-up, so just like a little bit, right, cuz I don’t wanna go crazy,” Chelsea explained of the amount of filler she was having injected before pouting for the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>In the videos, she also admitted to getting Botox touch-ups. Chelsea hinted in 2016 that she had Botox from her father, who was also a dentist.</p><p>Although Botox is frequently used by dentists to relax the stiff muscles that lead to TMJ, she posted an Instagram photo of her father caressing her forehead while people around them shined mobile phone flashlights on them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Chelsea captioned the image “Botox party” to confirm what was going on. However, she has never confessed to getting chin fillers.</p><p>Chelsea might have had a massive transformation via plastic surgery and weight loss, but tattoos have also aided her transformation. In the past few years, she has gotten a lot of tattoos.</p><p>She has inked flowers on her arms. On her hands, she has made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tattoos</a> of hearts, stars, arrows, and the word ‘gratitude.’ While many have bashed her for her tattoos, it has not stopped Chelsea from getting more body art.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Chelsea DeBoer?</h2><p>Chelsea became known to the public in 2011 after participating in MTV’s Teen Mom 2. She was a high school senior and a well-known softball star when she became pregnant with her then-boyfriend Adam Lind’s child, Aubree Sky Lind.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Besides that, Chelsea initially appeared in the second season of the television series 16 and Pregnant. Her presence on the show depicted her life and worsening relationship with Adam before the birth of their daughter.</p><p>She also appeared in a spin-off program, Teen Mom 2, which depicted her life after the birth of her daughter and the difficulties she had in the first year of parenting the child.&nbsp;</p><p>While on the show, she received a General Educational Development certificate and enrolled in cosmetology school, ultimately becoming a beautician and working in a salon.&nbsp;</p><p>She departed the reality program after 10 seasons in 2021, where she highlighted personal reasons for her choice of departure. While she was on the show, she met her current husband, Cole.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The duo started dating in 2014 and are now married and have been wonderful parents to Aubree, Watson, Layne, and Walker. They shared a passion for design and construction.&nbsp;</p><p>Chelsea and Cole’s enthusiasm for design grew when they started building their dream home in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in April 2020 — which prompted Chelsea to develop Aubree Says, a brand of kitchenware.&nbsp;</p><p>While Chelsea oversaw the majority of the creative and design work, Cole handled the practical work. After finishing their home, Chelsea and Cole realized they could pursue their passion for construction and design while assisting other couples.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Their passion became a reality TV show, greenlit by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HGTV</a>. With their new show, Down Home Fab, they seek to encourage couples who are ready to take a chance and embrace the process of creating something unique from the ground up.</p><p>With her show and passion for her work, Chelsea has become a global influence for women and young mothers everywhere.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Eddie Levert’s Children — The Singer Lost Two Kids in 2006 and 2008</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>RIP Gerald Levert and Sean Levert!</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Eddie-Levert-Children.jpg alt="Eddie Levert’s Children — The Singer Lost Two Kids in 2006 and 2008" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Eddie Levert is an American <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">musician</a> best recognized for his work as the lead vocalist for The O’Jays.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, he has seven children —&nbsp; Gerald Levert, Sean Levert, Eddie Jr. Levert, Kandice Levert, Eurydice Levert, Shawn Levert, and Ryan Levert.
