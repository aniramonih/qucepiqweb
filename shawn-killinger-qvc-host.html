She has a knack for bringing out the best in people and products, whether it’s on the QVC screen or on the news desk. She has been in the media industry for over two decades, starting from CBS where she rubbed shoulders with legends like David Bateman and Dan Rather. She then moved on to FOX and WRGB-TV, where she delivered the morning news and entertainment with flair and finesse. She joined QVC in 2007 and since then, she has been dazzling viewers with her charm, wit, and passion for beauty and fashion. She is a proud Penn State alumna with a degree in marketing and a command of Spanish, thanks to her childhood years in Mexico.

Shawn Killinger is more than a host, she is a friend.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1>Early Life</h2><p>Shawn Elizabeth Killinger was born on the 2nd of November 1979 in Michigan, United States. She grew up in Grosse Pointe and Detroit until 11 years old when her life changed dramatically. Her father got a job opportunity in Mexico City, and the whole family packed their bags and moved to a new country. Shawn was nervous and excited at the same time. She had to learn a new language, a new culture, and a new way of life. She enrolled in the International American School Foundation, where she met other kids from different backgrounds and countries. She quickly became fluent in Spanish and Mexican, and developed a passion for travel and learning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/QVC-Host-Shawn-Killinger-.jpg><p>Shawn returned to the US with her family when she was 15 years old.
