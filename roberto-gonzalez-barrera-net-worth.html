Roberto Gonzalez Barrera (September 1, 1930 – 25 August 2012) was the chairman of Gruma and Banorte; the first being the biggest tortilla maker in the world and the latter the largest Mexican-owned private bank in the country. Raised in poverty, Barrera was just five years old when he first started selling eggs, bread, vegetables and other food supplies in his native town. At the age of 15, he received a very useful piece of advice from his grandfather as he told him to stick with the product that made him most money. Three years later, he had his first encounter with corn and recognized a big opportunity in it.</p><p>After a talk with his dad, the Barreras decided to buy their first corn mill, which today has evolved to what is known as Maseca. Thus, Roberto Gonzalez Barrera became a billionaire in 2011. But he did so, partly to his other "thing", i.e., being the main shareholder of the Banorte financial group since 1992. After facing various health problems, Barrera died in Houston, Texas on 25th August 2012 due to complications of cancer. Roberto Gonzalez Barrera was also known under the nicknames "El Maseco" and "Don Maseco".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqjtculoKimkZ6%2Fpr%2BOq6abnaKpvG6zzqexmqSVr3qjrdGrnKuZXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-downey-jr-daughter-first-picture.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Downey Jr shares first photo of daughter Avri</span></a>
