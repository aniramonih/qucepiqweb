He is endorsed by big brands and even started designing for Lakai Shoes. The online fame soon translated into him getting a Hollywood manager and now Nico is a full-fledged actor. But despite his openness about almost everything, the actor has been especially protective about his love-life, with his girlfriend.</p><h2>Nico Hiraga Girlfriend - Relationship Detail of the Actor</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2021/03/nico-hiraga-girlfriend-2021.jpg alt=nico-hiraga-girlfriend-2021 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Nico Hiraga is dating his girlfriend.
