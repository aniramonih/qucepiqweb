There are just so many cute styles and silhouettes to choose from! On a chilly day, we’re all about a turtleneck to shield our collars from the cold. A cardigan is a great layering piece over a basic top, and a sweater dress is a fun frock to wear once temperatures drop. But one type of knit we’re still on the hunt for is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sweater we can rock on date night and beyond</a>. We want to show a little skin (tastefully, of course) with a flirty cut while staying warm at the same time.</p><p>Luckily for all of Us, we just found the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">perfect pullover</a>. This off-the-shoulder sweater from Amazon is casual enough to be worn during the day yet sultry enough to pull off at night. It’s rare to find a sweater that strikes that delicate balance! Sound enticing?
