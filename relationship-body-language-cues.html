If you're getting the idea that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>your significant other wants out</a>, you need to be not just listening to what they say, but also looking at what their body is communicating. The truth is, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>body language cues</a> paint a much clearer picture of what's actually going on in a relationship than what is spoken. From the way someone stands to the way they hug, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>body language can express</a> all the things someone is thinking, but not necessarily saying.</p><p>Curious as to whether or not your significant other's hands, eyes, feet, and even elbows are <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/doomed-relationship/>hinting at trouble ahead</span>? We've rounded up the body language cues experts say signal <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>the end of your relationship</a> so that you can start having those serious conversations, if necessary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/senior-couple-arguing.jpg><p>If you're worried about the status of your relationship, then look at how your partner sits when the two of you talk. "If your partner consistently turns their feet and torso away from you when speaking, then they are probably losing interest in you," explains <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>Jon Rhodes</strong></a>, a clinical hypnotherapist in the U.K. "They may still turn their head towards you to be polite, but their feet and body are saying they want to get away from you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/shutterstock_678677329.jpg><p>Try as your partner might to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cover up their real feelings</a>, their body language is bound to give them away in the end. And though everyone exhibits nervousness in different ways, Washington, D.C.-based body language expert <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>Janine Driver</strong></a>&nbsp;notes that without a doubt, the biting of the lip "says that [your partner] is holding something back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/senior-couple-on-bench.jpg><p>When you and your partner are having a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>heated conversation</a>, the last thing you want to see is their legs crossed. Why? As &nbsp;psychologist <strong>Travis Bradberry</strong>, president of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>TalentSmart</a> in San Diego,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>wrote for <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Entrepreneur</a>, this can "signal that a person is mentally, emotionally, and physically closed off." He added, "It's not intentional, which is why it's so revealing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/fake-smile-1.jpg><p>People in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>happy relationships</a> don't have to fake their enthusiasm. So, seeing your partner with "a smile that doesn't go all the way up to their eyes" is usually a pretty good indication that something in the partnership is amiss, according to Virginia psychotherapist and relationship coach <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>Toni Coleman</strong></a>, LCSW, CMC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/woman-sighing.jpg><p>Believe it or not, there are also body language cues in your partner's voice and intonations. And, according to Coleman, one vocal indication that something in the relationship is off is when your partner is adding "non-audible noises like sighs, pauses, and silences that didn't used to be an issue" into every conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/senior-husband-wife-argument.jpg><p>Emotional closeness is often mirrored by physical closeness, so pay attention to how much space your partner puts between the two of you when you go out to dinner or just relax on the couch. "One posture sign that says the relationship is not going to last is subtle leaning back away from their partner when sitting or standing together," says Coleman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/couple-arguing.jpg><p>If and when your partner uses their hands to gesture something, pay attention to which hand they use—left or right. Why? "Too many left-handed gestures are associated with someone being uncomfortable with what they're saying to you,"&nbsp;body language expert <strong>Jan Hargrave</strong> told <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>ABC News</a>. "Rubbing of the eye too much with the left hand in the left eye says, 'Do not see very clearly what I'm saying, because I'm not being fully honest with you.'"</p><p>Basically, if you notice your spouse starting to utilize their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-replaced=801 href=#>left hand</a> more and more, it's probably time to start questioning those "late nights at the office."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/woman-with-dilated-pupils.jpg><p>A 2017 study published in the journal <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Royal Society Open Science</a> found that when you see someone you're sexually attracted to, your eyes give you away almost instantly. That's because dilated pupils are a sign of sexual arousal. So, if you think a lover is losing interest in you physically, just look into their eyes; their pupils will tell you exactly what you want to know.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/gay-couple-in-bed.jpg><p>Naturally, your significant other is going to look at their phone every now and again—but if you notice that your partner only ever seems to check their notifications when you are talking to them, then you may want to have a serious conversation about where the relationship is going.</p><p>"If your partner is always on their cell phone—looking at YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram—they may be more focused on what's going on there than in the relationship," explains&nbsp;<strong>Katie Ziskind</strong>, LMFT, a licensed marriage and family therapist and owner of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Wisdom Within Counseling</a> in Niantic, Connecticut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/businesswoman-breaking-eye-contact.jpg><p>You don't have to be staring at your partner 24/7 for there to be a definite connection, but according to Ziskind, if your partner is never making eye contact with you, that could be a troubling sign. "When people avoid eye contact, it can mean that they're lying or are disconnected emotionally," she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/couple-making-eye-contact.jpg><p>Though a lack of eye contact can signal that a relationship is heading in the wrong direction, so can too much eye contact. "It is common knowledge that disinterested people will look in any other direction for something or someone more interesting," body language expert <strong>Steven Keyl </strong>explained to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Insider</a>. "Since we know looking away will be <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>interpreted as rude</a>, people overcompensate by making too much eye contact."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/senior-couple-distant.jpg><p>As <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>Ali Craig</strong></a>, an international consultant, explained to The Insider, the distance someone keeps between you and them says a lot.</p><p>"People who like each other generally don't have problems being in close physical proximity to each other," she says. "If you dislike someone, however, you are less likely to position yourself very close to them. You'll keep a 'safe' amount of distance between the two of you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/gay-couple-in-kitchen.jpg><p>When people enter a relationship, they naturally start being more vulnerable with their partner, and "opening their stomach area to someone is a growing sign of trust," says <strong>David Barbour</strong>, co-founder of wellness company&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Vivio Life Sciences</a> in Sherman Oaks, California. So, if someone starts crossing their arms to cover their stomach, it may signal that things are amiss in the relationship.</p><p>"If someone starts avoiding such intimacy or starts a process of 'shelling up' and guarding themselves, it may just be an unconscious reaction to losing feelings," Barbour says. "They no longer desire that relationship or intimacy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/woman-pursing-her-lips.jpg><p>When you confront your significant other about the status of your relationship, pay attention not just to what they say, but what their mouth does while they say it. "[Pursed lips] can indicate extreme anxiety, withholding information, and withholding aggression," body language expert <strong>Patti Wood</strong>, author of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Snap: Making the Most of First Impressions, Body Language, and Charisma</a>, wrote on <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>her website</a>. Additionally, "when you are nervous, your mouth becomes dry, and you lick your lips and swallow as you struggle to find the right words to say."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/man-with-hands-in-pockets.jpg><p>If your partner is using their pockets to hide their hands while you converse, then it's possible (and likely even) that they are hiding something from you. "Liars tend to keep their hands hidden and still," Wood noted on her website. "When people are trying to hide their true feeling or the truth, they may stick their hands in their pockets, clench them together, or hold them behind their backs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/couple-walking.jpg><p>One of the signs of a strong and healthy relationship is synchronized walking. As Wood explained to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>, "The goal is for couples to walk with their feet side by side on an invisible line. When this walking pattern is disrupted, it indicates that there is disconnect between the couple."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/hug.jpg><p>Though pats on the back are comforting in times of distress, they're the last thing anyone wants from the person who's supposed to be their romantic partner—and they're never a good sign, body-language-wise.</p><p>"If your partner begins to pat you on the back during a hug, it immediately desexualizes it," Wood told Good Housekeeping. "Let's face it: You and your partner aren't&nbsp;just&nbsp;teammates."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/woman-feeling-neck.jpg><p>As Wood explained to Good Housekeeping, touching the "throat indicates that someone is keeping something from another person." Why? According to Wood, the throat is the "gateway for words," making it "one of the most vulnerable parts of the body."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/uncomfortable-hug.jpg><p>Where do your partner's elbows go when the two of you hug? If they tend to stay locked during embraces, then it's more than likely that your significant other is purposely keeping their arms close to their body so as to make as little contact with you as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/man-folding-arms.jpg><p>Though it's important for partners to be independent and think for themselves, there are certain instances in which being on the same page is vital to the success of a relationship.</p><p>"It's troubling when one person in the relationship doesn't show the correct emotional response given the situation,"&nbsp;<strong>Susan Constantine</strong>, human behavioral expert and author of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reading Body Language</a>, told&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>. "If your partner is stressed, your face should reflect that. The same goes for any emotion that your partner feels."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/furrowing-eyebrows.jpg><p>Every part of the human body is capable of giving away a person's innermost irritations, including our eyebrows. As trial lawyer <strong>Maria Katrina Karos</strong> explained to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>CNN</a>, the furrowing of the eyebrows "almost always means something negative," so pay attention to your partner's brow movements if you're worried about your future together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/woman-points-finger-at-man.jpg><p>"If your husband is bearing his teeth or jabbing his finger at your chest, he may be unconsciously trying to threaten you into submission—even if he doesn't actually touch you," <strong>Stella Resnick</strong>, PhD, a psychotherapist and author of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Pleasure Zone: Why We Resist Good Feelings & How to Let Go and Be Happy</a>, told <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Redbook</a>. In these instances, it's possible that your argument is more than meets the eye, and the fate of your relationship depends on you getting to the bottom of the real issue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/senior-couple-holding-hands.jpg><p>Naturally, not all people enjoy public displays of affection. But if you find that your partner is shying away from holding your hand, even inside the comfort of your own home, then there might be some growing feelings of disdain and resentment there that are worth addressing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/woman-places-hand-on-mans-shoulder.jpg><p>People tend to express their fondness for their partners through physical contact. Should you start to notice that your partner shies away from your embraces and advances, this might be an unconscious body language cue that the honeymoon phase is long over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/on-phone-in-restaurant.jpg><p>Your significant other should be cherishing your time together, not glancing at their watch or phone while you talk. It's when your relationship becomes a nuisance to your partner's precious time rather than an enjoyment that you know that there are larger issues at play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/couple-hug.jpg><p>Pay attention to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>way your partner kisses and hugs you</a> and whether those embraces feel any different. "Kissing is an emotional, biological, and physiological boost," body language expert&nbsp;<strong>Tonya Reiman</strong> told <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Business Insider</a>. "If your partner kisses you with less enthusiasm, it's a red flag."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/fake-hug.jpg><p>When a relationship is on the rocks, <strong>Joe Navarro</strong>, MA, a 25-year veteran of the FBI and author of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>What Every Body Is Saying</a>, says that couples tend to only then touch with their fingertips or for a short amount of time.</p><p>"This is called 'distal touching' and is our subconscious way of touching those we dislike or can barely tolerate," he wrote for <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Psychology Today</a>. "When you or your partner begins to touch less or merely with the fingertips, loving sentiments have probably been withdrawn."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/disappointed-couple-in-bed.jpg><p>"Sex needs a huge amount of connection to be enjoyed," <strong>Arrey John Arrey </strong>writes in his book&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Secret of a Successful Relationship & Marriage</a>.&nbsp;"When your partner becomes unresponsive to sex or avoids sex totally, then this is an obvious sign that your partner is unhappy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/woman-angry-at-husband.jpg><p>When your partner responds to your questions and prompts with short, one-worded answers like "yes," "no," and "OK," this is likely a verbal sign that your relationship is on the rocks. Of course, it's possible that your significant other could just be stressed or busy, but if their tone is agitated and aggressive, then it's safe to assume that you're the source of their frustration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/husband-rolling-eyes.jpg><p>According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>John Gottman</strong></a>, a leading expert in marital stability, the number one <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>predictor of divorce</a> is contempt—expressed through things like eye rolls, mimicry, and sneering. As soon as you notice contemptuous body language cues seeping into your relationship, make an effort to talk to your partner about what's bothering them and (hopefully) you can patch up problem areas before it's too late.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZe8pcWMpZinn6WWtKZ5wq6crGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./weakest-pokemon-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>20 Weakest Pokemon Of All Time</span></a>
