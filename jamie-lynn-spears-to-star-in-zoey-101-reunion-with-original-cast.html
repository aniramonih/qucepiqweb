He has since been accused of misconduct and&nbsp;<a href=#>“sexualizing” teens</a>&nbsp;in that role.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He said in 2021</a>&nbsp;that if some people found him difficult to work with, it was because he has “high standards. I’m very willing to defend creative things that I believe in.”</p><p>He added: “I couldn’t, and I wouldn’t have the long-term friendships and continued loyalty from so many reputable people if I’d mistreated my actors of any age, especially minors.”</p><p>A Paramount+ rep told The Post Schneider isn’t involved in the new project.</p><p><a href=#>Golden Globe winner Austin Butler,</a> who appeared on several “Zoey” episodes, won’t be participating either.
