An athlete who enjoyed playing cards, watching TV, and spending time with friends in his free time, Ty graduated high school with a GPA of over 4.0 after becoming the 2017 and 2018 MVP of his team. He won bronze medals in the 100 fly and breaststroke at CIF Sectional competitions, and he held school records in the 50 free, 200 and 400 free relays, as well as the 200 medley relay. After considering schools such as California Baptist, UOP, and Utah, Ty chose Arizona, naming it ‚Äúthe best all-around‚Äù and praising its great team culture and coaches.</p><p><strong>Stephanie Wells</strong> Wrote,</p><p>Facebook family and friends please say a prayer for My Family and for my big brother Joe Wells and his family‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so lost 4 words .God give US strength.

Not only did these qualifications give me an NCAA B cut, but they also made me the fastest on my team in the 50 Y breast! Now, looking back at the prior seasons, it‚Äôs easy to see how much I‚Äôve improved throughout my collegiate career. In 2020-21, I held my team‚Äôs third fastest time in the 100 breast with a time of 53.46 and an NCAA B cut qualification; in 2019-20, I swam a personal best at the Pac-12 Championships in both the 100 breast with a time of 53.27 and again for an NCAA B cut, as well as the 200 breast with 1:59.51; and finally, in 2018-19, I held the fourth-fastest Wildcat time in the 100 breast with a time of 53.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=TY_Wells_Motorcycle_Accident_What_was_his_cause_of_Death></span>TY Wells Motorcycle Accident: What was his cause of Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>This weekend, the community of Ripon, California, and the University of Arizona are both mourning the loss of TY Wells, a beloved alumnus and friendly neighbor.

Unfortunately, prospects for a bright future were suddenly silenced when he was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident whose full details have yet to be made public. All those who knew him are deeply grieving his loss, but are hopeful that his smile, rambunctious attitude, and vivacious spirit live on in others‚Äô memories.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>How did Brady Hessbrook die?
