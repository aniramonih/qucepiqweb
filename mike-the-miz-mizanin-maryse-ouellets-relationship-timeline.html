There’s no one that supports me more,” the WWE superstar told the U.K.’s&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Metro</a>&nbsp;</i>newspaper in February 2021. “Whenever she is outside — when she was outside the ring and being my manager, she motivated me, she made me better.”</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “Honestly, whenever you have a beautiful wife and she’s staring at you and you’re in a Speedo, you kinda stand a little taller, to be honest!”</p><p class=p1>The Miz — who <a href=#>wed the former WWE Divas champion in February 2014</a> — has also credited his wife with helping to inspire his <a href=#>post-<i>Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;</i>fitness regimen</a>. (He <a href=#>competed on season 30 with partner<strong> Witney Carson</strong></a>.)</p><p class=p1>“I wouldn’t even know if you guys can tell, but I’ve lost a lot of weight,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Real World&nbsp;</i></a>alum<a href=#> told<i>&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>and other reporters in October 2021</a>. “I’ve lost probably 15 lbs since I’ve started. … I’m trying to get [into] dancer shape.”</p><p class=p1>However, Ouellet was not as impressed with <a href=#>her man’s slimmer physique</a>, even telling the Utah-based choreographer that he needed to eat more food.</p><p class=p1>“[Maryse]&nbsp;doesn’t like me skinny. She likes me a little thicker with a little bit more meat,” The Miz told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “When you’re dancing here, it’s like you can’t eat enough. And honestly, I’m just getting that body now. Whenever I get back to wrestling, it’ll be weights upon weights to get back into wrestling shape.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Miz and Mrs&nbsp;</i>reality stars <a href=#>expanded their brood in March 2018</a> when their daughter Monroe was born.</p><p class=p1>“I’m at her service no matter what. I’ve never had anyone have so much control over me,” the Ohio native — who also shares daughter Madison with his wife — <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>one month after Monroe’s arrival</a>. “I wanted to be the dad that was able to feed my daughter, hold my daughter, really be there for my daughter. I want to be the dad that’s here. I want to see her. Every day, her face changes, her body changes, everything about her is just changing every single day. It’s crazy.”</p><p class=p1>The Miz and the Madroe Productions founder’s romance has continued to flourish over the years as <a href=#>they balance their busy careers in and out of the ring</a> with raising their two daughters.</p><p class=p1>“Mothers don’t take a day off. It’s 365 days of care, protection, support, worry and love…. also it’s mom, mom, mom, hey mom, mom. What? I forgot. Lol, thank you Maryse for doing everything you can to always make our girls smile,” The Miz — <a href=#>who renewed his wedding vows with the Canada native</a> in December 2021 — gushed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in May 2022. “There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t step back and think how amazing you truly are.&nbsp;<a href=#>#HappyMothersDay&nbsp;today and everyday</a>. I love you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to relive the WWE couple’s complete relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq3xGaroZ1dora7ecyisZqmmaN6rq3RsqqeZZ%2Bqsq24xK2qZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-weaver-height-age-wife-biography-wiki-net-worth-12303-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Weaver Height, Age, Wife, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
