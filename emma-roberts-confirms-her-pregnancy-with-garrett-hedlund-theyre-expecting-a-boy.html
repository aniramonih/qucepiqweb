<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Emma Roberts confirms her pregnancy with Garrett Hedlund, theyre expecting a boy</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In June, <a href=#>Us Weekly reported</a> that Emma Roberts and Garrett Hedlund were expecting their first child. At the time, I was like “wait, they *just* started dating and they were only hooking up, right?” Wrong. They’ve actually been happening for more than a year. They were first seen together in March/April 2019, and while the rumor at the time was that it was just a noncommittal hookup situation, they seemed to be seriously dating and maybe even exclusive for a year before she got knocked up. That being said, sources still claimed that <a href=#>it was a “surprise” pregnancy</a>.</p><p>I wondered if Emma would even bother confirming the news on her social media, or with a statement to People Magazine or something like that. Turns out, <a href=#>she did</a>. She posted the Instagram above last night with the message “Me…and my two favorite guys.” So she’s expecting a boy. Meanwhile, Kirsten Dunst seethes! (No, she’s fine. But damn, this is exactly what Kiki wanted from Garrett.)</p><p>Not that every expecting couple has to get married, but… am I the only one surprised that they’re not announcing this with an engagement? They both seem like the type to get married because they’re having a baby. I don’t spy a ring anywhere. And sheesh, these photos are super-awkward! Congrats to them though, Garrett is a hot piece and the baby will be gorgeous.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/emma-3.jpg alt="emma 3" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Backgrid, Instagram.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmb29obIVze8SmpJqXoqSvpr7TrJacp56btrO50pifnqqPpb%2Bms82apZyxj6y2tbS%2BoJirqpWpwaC0xJ2jrqaUlMGpsdirnJidqKWypMDIp56YmY%2BXvLp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-cannon-wnba-is-she-mgk-wife-baby-mama.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Cannon WNBA: Is She MGK Wife &amp;amp; Baby Mama?</span></a>
