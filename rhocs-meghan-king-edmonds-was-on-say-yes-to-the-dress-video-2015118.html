Before the marketing exec, 30, married former professional baseball player <strong>Jim Edmonds</strong> last fall, she hit up the legendary Kleinfeld Bridal boutique in NYC, which means that she also made a sure-footed appearance on TLC’s Say Yes to the Dress.</p><p>Edmonds has gotten some slack for her “mean girl” persona on RHOC, but in the SYTTD episode “All Hands on Deck,” we must give credit where credit is due. Not only does the blonde bombshell know exactly what she wants when it comes to choosing her dream dress, she humbly ignores the constant reminders that she has an incredibly toned physique (“I don’t want to see my abs on my wedding day!”). Plus, the St. Louis native refuses to spend more than $5,000 on her dress, even though she and her now-husband live the luxe life.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=311 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Meghan Edmonds wedding dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After challenging the salesladies’ patience just a bit, Edmonds ultimately settles on a sweet, vintage-feeling dress with a sheer, straight neckline, which she has altered into a sweetheart shape.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That said, she wore a completely different dress—a bow-topped strapless number—at her <a href=#>October 2014 nuptials</a>, which didn’t take place in Bora Bora, as she mentioned during the episode, but at picturesque Forest Park in her home city, St. Louis.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=311 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Meghan Edmonds wedding dress (farther away shot)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Watch a clip above, and see the <a href=#>entire episode here</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGaroJ%2BYwG65xKCfmqZdoLavs4yem6annpnAbsPArGSopl2orrp52J6qZqyfYsGpsYydqZ6ro2LDqrDEqGRraGFqfnKE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./profesora-de-cochabamba-video-original.html><span>←</span><span>Profesora de cochabamba Video Original The Talks Today</span></a>
