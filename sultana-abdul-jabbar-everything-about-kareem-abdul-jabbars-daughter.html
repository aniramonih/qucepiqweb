Additionally, even though she was her parents’ youngest child, she did not have the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with her father in her early years.</p><h2><span id=Where_exactly_has_Sultana_been_hiding_out_these_days>Where exactly has Sultana been hiding out these days?</span></h2><p>Is she alone or does she have a significant other? Now, if you’re interested in learning more about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s daughter, Sultana Abdul-Jabbar, have a look at the story that can be seen below. Let’s get started!</p><p>As of the year 2022, Sultana Abdul-Jabbar will be 43 years old because she was born in the United States of America in 1979.</p><p>Additionally, it is said that she celebrates her birthday around April; however, she has not disclosed the exact date that she was born. She is one of three daughters that her mother, Janice Brown, also known as Habiba Abdul-Jabbar, and her father, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, have together.</p><p>Sultan, who was brought up in a Muslim family, practices the religion much like her mother and father did. In addition to discussing her ancestry, it is important to note that she was born in the United States and has African and Trinidadian ancestry.</p><p>Some of you may be unaware of this, but Sultana’s mother was only three months pregnant when her marriage to Sultana’s father ended in divorce. As a consequence of this, she spent the majority of her childhood living at home with her single mother.</p><p>Before beginning her studies at a higher level, Sultana received her education in the comfort of her own home. It is believed that she attended the University of California, Santa Cruz beginning in the year 2000 and graduating in the year 2002. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Literature from an accredited university.</p><h2><span id=Who_Are_Sultana_Abdul-Jabbar8217s_Parents>Who Are Sultana Abdul-Jabbar’s Parents?</span></h2><p>As was said previously, Sultana Jabbar is the youngest daughter of her parents, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Habiba Abdul-Jabbar. Habiba is Sultana’s mother, while Kareem is her father. The ceremony took place in Washington, District of Columbia, on May 28, 1971, and only close family and friends were invited.</p><p>According to rumors, her mother works in the fashion industry and owns the clothing business Tutu Glam. Janice Brown was Habiba’s birth name, but she changed it after being married to her ex-husband and taking the name Habiba. Along the same lines, she converted from Christianity to Islam after being pressured to do so by her ex-lover.</p><p>Sultana Abdul-Jabbar’s mom Habiba Abdul Jabbar, and dad Kareem Abdul-Jabbar When Sultana and Habiba Abdul-Jabbar were children, Sultana’s mother Habiba Abdul-Jabbar and Sultana’s father Kareem Abdul-Jabbar went to an event together.</p><p>On the other hand, her father is a former professional basketball player in the United States and is regarded as one of the top three players in the annals of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p><p>He played in the NBA for a total of 20 seasons and contributed to six different championship teams, both as a player and as an assistant coach for two different squads.</p><p>Even though they were married for more than half a decade and had three children together, the former couple’s marriage was not successful in the long run. Then, in December 1973, Sultana’s mother and father divorced each other.</p><p>According to the sources, the former couple who were head over heels in love for one another lived apart for a short while not long after they got married. After some time, Kareem asked for the former husband and wife’s marriage to be dissolved in a religious ceremony, and they complied.</p><p>Even though the former couple had grown apart, they continued to have children. Because of this, they welcomed a daughter named Sultana Abdul-Jabbar as well as a son named Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr. In 1978, the longtime couple Kareem and Habiba finalized their decision to end their marriage.</p><p>On the other hand, several gossip magazines have proposed that his girlfriend at the time, Cheryl Pistono, was the driving force behind their decision to split up. It is said that she was successful in persuading him to cease the courtship with his ex-wife.</p><h2><span id=Does_Sultana_Have_Any_Siblings>Does Sultana Have Any Siblings?</span></h2><p>A sister named Habiba and a brother named Kareem Jr. are Sultana’s biological siblings, and she also has two half-brothers and two half-sisters named Amir and Adam.</p><p>Her older sister, Habiba Alcindor, was born in 1972, making her the first child of her parents. After Habiba was born, her mother and father immediately began experiencing issues in their relationship with one another.</p><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his now ex-wife Habiba welcomed their second bundle of joy, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr., in 1976. This occurred four years after the birth of their first child. Following his parents’ divorce, he entered the world. Additionally, she is the half-sister of Amir, who was born to her father’s second wife, Cheryl Pistono.</p><p>When Sultana Abdul-Jabbar was a child, she is pictured here with her parents and her siblings.<br>Sultana Abdul-Jabbar is here with her father Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and her siblings Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr. and Habiba Alcindor as well as her half-brother Amir.</p><p>At this point, all of Sultana’s siblings had reached adulthood and found success in their chosen fields of work. Her older sister Habiba is a journalist, but her brother is following in their father’s footsteps by pursuing a football career.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Kenny Holland Marries His Girlfriend And Expands His Family</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Who Is Katia Washington?
