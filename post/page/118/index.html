<a href=../../../how-thick-is-r38-attic-insulation-html.html></a>
Answer
R-38 Insulation is available in various thicknesses.
The fibreglass is available in a variety of sizes in the form of rolls, sometimes known as batts. The thickness of an R-38 fibreglass batt should be roughly 12 inches, however the thickness of cellulose insulation in a completed, fitted product will be far more than this.
Another debate is if r38 attic insulation is sufficient. The R-Value of insulation is a measure of the material’s capacity to resist heat flow.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Inside Look at Kim Kardashian's New $70 Million Malibu Home</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>
