She later began co-hosting the show F1 a la une with Denis Brogniart. It was only in effect until 2012. On the TF1 channel, she also hosted a show called Confessions Intimes.</p><h2>Some Marion Jolles Facts</h2><p>Marion began interviewing numerous F1 pilots during the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona, Spain, and many praised her for her ability to speak perfect English.&nbsp;She also co-hosts a show called Des talents a coupe le soufflé with Arthur, a well-known TV presenter, and comedian. Marion’s husband, Romain, was in a catastrophic vehicle accident during the Bahrain Grand Prix, although he was only slightly hurt. Her spouse competes for the Haas F1 team, which is based in France. She is also five years Romain’s senior.</p><p>Romain was involved in a horrific incident during a race at the Bahrain Grand Prix: it was stated that his vehicle was moving at 192 kph (119mph) when he was struck by a metal barrier.&nbsp;It created a large explosion, which resulted in a large blaze during the Bahrain Grand Prix. The impact force was 67 Gs, which is equivalent to 67 times the body’s weight. And hard braking in an F1 vehicle produces around 6 Gs of force. Romain was stuck in the automobile for 27 seconds, but he was fortunate. He just had minor burns and a damaged left ankle.</p><h2>Marriage</h2><p>Marion is blissfully married to her F1 racing driver boyfriend, Romain Grosjean.
