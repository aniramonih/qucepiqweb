Then, Swayze's mom's dance school merged with Niemi's theater group. Niemi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2080661/Dirty-Dancing-star-Patrick-Swayzes-courageous-battle-wife-Lisa.html>described</a> Swayze thus:</p><p class=dh>"Patrick was tanned, buff, had a dazzling smile and a reputation as a Casanova. I wasn't just a wallflower; I was an expert, practised wallflower."</p><p class=dh>Their first contact was when they passed each other while coming in and out of the theater. Swayze reached over and pinched Niemi on her bottom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ebc7e72beef0f4295f5d3b7673d0002e.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze and his wife Lisa Niemi pose at the Portrait Studio during the AFI Fest on November 5, 2005, in Hollywood, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Afterward, he greeted her in a friendly and mischievous tone, saying, "Hey there, cutie." However, Niemi said, "Oh, brother," before rolling her eyes and passing him.</p><p class=dh>Niemi wrote that the whole idea of marrying Swayze came about abruptly. Five years after they met, they started talking about the future, but most of their conversations bordered on what they wanted as professional dancers.</p><p class=dh>The pair were living together in a tiny apartment in New York City. Niemi revealed that they were in the middle of a tickling fight when Swayze put his arms around her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/02214d52b59a7995cb000cb07c577f11.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Lisa Niemi (L) and actor Patrick Swayze speak onstage during the 9th annual Costume Designers Guild Awards held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on February 17, 2007 in Beverly Hills, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>When she asked what the issue was, his face flushed.

A steady and stable presence in our lives. In some ways we were nurtured more by my father than by my mother."</p><p class=dh>Besides being an excellent ballet dancer thanks to his mother's teaching, Swayze was also great at sports. He desired to get a football scholarship but had those dreams cut short after suffering a horrific knee injury on the field at 18.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7bbe077ab87b8f6e7f74c9454a5d0f36.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze on the set of "The Outsiders", circa 1982. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Following the injury, doctors told Swayze he would never walk normally again. However, he was determined to prove the doctors wrong and began ballet classes as rehabilitation.</p><p class=dh>Eventually, Swayze had to abandon his dreams of having a career in ballet due to a terrible infection in his injured knee. He found it hard to cope without ballet and later <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/15738757/how-patrick-swayze-battled-grief-over-dads-death-a-tragic-miscarriage-and-crippling-booze-addiction/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Leaving the ballet created a void in me that I spent years trying to fill."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/3db61e41fada81be7298074e43fa8c88.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>American actors Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey star in the film 'Dirty Dancing', 1987. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After being forced to end his ballet career, a devastated Swayze turned to acting. He moved to Los Angeles and impressed critics and filmgoers in his first movie "Skatetown USA." Eventually, the role led to the TV series "The Renegades."</p><p class=dh>Just as Swayze's career was set to take off, he suffered another heartbreak following his beloved father's sudden death after a heart attack. It was in 1982, and Don was 57. Swayze felt bottomless pain after his dad's death, and he became a heavy drinker. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/15738757/how-patrick-swayze-battled-grief-over-dads-death-a-tragic-miscarriage-and-crippling-booze-addiction/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'd never been much of a drinker but one of the first things I did after my dad died was buy a case of his favourite beer, Budweiser."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5da6be24d17d64ba96955b077a2b21c2.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>American actor Patrick Swayze (1952 - 2009), circa 1990. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Swayze hated the beer's taste but drank much of it nonetheless in a bid to get drunk. However, no matter how much he drank, he could not stop the pain. Thus, he continued drinking.</p><p class=dh>Swayze's breakdown marked the start of his lifelong battle with alcohol and depression. His former agent Kate Edwards said he found a way to cope with his dad's death, but his way of doing so became self-destructive.</p><p class=dh>Edwards further explained that Swayze did not know where to place or put his grief. Also, he did not really know what to do and how to cope.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4ab0c2a3243804f24e1a79feac647e8a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze attends Stand Up To Cancer at the Kodak Theatre on September 5, 2008 in Hollywood, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PATRICK LONGED TO BE A FATHER, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED</strong></p><p class=dh>Throughout their 34-year marriage, Swayze and Niemi never became parents.

Even now, neither of us can talk about that day without tearing up."</p><p class=dh>Swayze's depression and alcoholism reached new heights after taking up a role in "Father Hood." In the film, he portrayed a crime boss learning to be a father and reached a crisis point afterward.</p><p class=dh>Swayze was drinking so much that he passed out several times during filming that he had to be woken up to continue. However, he got through the movie and decided he needed to take care of things.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>On a Monday afternoon, doctors told Niemi they had come to that point.</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PATRICK'S BATTLE WITH ADDICTION AND SCARY DIAGNOSIS</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite Swayze's best attempts to take care of things, his depression remained. Also, he battled with his sex symbol image and desperately wanted people to take him seriously as an actor.</p><p class=dh>However, his career started dwindling in the 1990s, and he experienced yet another tragedy when his sister Vicky killed herself in 1994.</p><p class=dh>In 1997, Swayze was almost paralyzed after being thrown from a horse.

However, a career break and the purchase of a remote ranch in New Mexico brought the couple back together.</p><p class=dh>Swayze devoted his time to riding horses and seemed happier, but his happiness did not last as he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dc208a0a393c83933d7b8185e7eeac99.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze dances with Lisa Niemi during the 1994 World Music Awards on May 4, 1994. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Niemi detailed how they found out about his diagnosis in her article for Daily Mail. She said they were at a friend's place on New Year's Eve 2008. After raising glasses for a toast, Swayze grimaced but said nothing.</p><p class=dh>The following week, he came to her and asked if his eyes looked yellow. She confirmed they did and suggested they go to the doctor.</p><p class=dh>Tests and scans revealed Swayze had a mass on the head of his pancreas.

The next morning, a young surgeon revealed the diagnosis to Swayze, who looked quickly at his wife, with alarm rising in his eyes.</p><p class=dh>In an interview with ET, Niemi described Swayze's battle with the disease as the worst thing in the world to go through. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/patrick-swayzes-widow-lisa-niemi-opens-up-about-his-life-and-legacy-exclusive-130538>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"You spend every day fighting for that person's life.

They had lunch and enjoyed the afternoon, watching the sunset with the smell of warm pine around them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/35f719082204df25a1900882b1789c98.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze and wife Lisa Niemi pose at the premiere of "Rocky Balboa" on December 13, 2006, in Hollywood, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The couple joined friends at the "Burro Pasture" to round up all the cattle in late June. It involved doctoring and branding the new calves near the Tecolote river.</p><p class=dh>Swayze wore his cowboy gear and chaps and jumped on a horse before roping and bringing the calves for treatment.</p><p class=dh>Soon, it started raining, and Swayze was soaked to the bone. The couple was wet and cold as they hurriedly loaded the horses, grabbed their overcoats, and got into their cars.</p><p class=dh>However, they were having fun, and Niemi was laughing inside because her husband was not supposed to be alive, but there he was doing ranch work and fully living his life.</p><p class=dh>She wrote that despite her husband's illness and the discomfort, Swayze remained determined to continue working on "The Beast," a new television detective series filmed in Chicago. The project turned out to be an amazing experience and inspired many people.</p><p class=dh>Niemi further wrote that Swayze was transformed by the series and was like a different man. His enormous burst of energy flooded her as he seemed like his old take-charge self and went non-stop. She was happy to have him back.</p><p class=dh>Also, Swayze was determined for the show not to make his role less demanding and came back one day angry that they had asked a stuntman to perform a stunt meant for him. In September, he turned to Niemi with hope in his eyes and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2080661/Dirty-Dancing-star-Patrick-Swayzes-courageous-battle-wife-Lisa.html>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I've been feeling so good… I almost feel normal."</p><p class=dh>Then came the time Swayze had to lose his hair. Niemi went to the barn, got a pair of horse clippers and a size-15 blade, and cut her husband's hair. Afterward, she thought he looked great and beautiful every time she looked at him.</p><p class=dh>Swayze was on Abraxane, a chemo drug used for breast cancer. As soon as he was on the drug, his blood and scans improved immediately. However, he was spending more time in bed feeling unwell and had an increased abdominal discomfort.</p><p class=dh>Doctors warned about rolling infections. Chemotherapy could not cure Swayze. His best hope was living long enough for the advent of better treatment. However, nothing was forthcoming.</p><p class=dh>By September 2009, Swayze was not well enough to cope with chemotherapy and became gravely ill again. Doctors told Niemi they had come to that point on a Monday afternoon.</p><p class=dh>Niemi knew she had to let go, or it would have shredded her heart. She felt as though she had failed, and the only way to bear it was always to remind herself that it was not about her but her and Swayze's love.</p><p class=dh>Niemi revealed Swayze spoke his last words on a Friday evening. Her brother, Eric, and his wife, Mary, had come to see him through the bedroom door. A woozy Swayze saw them and was pleased and said hi to them. Niemi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2080661/Dirty-Dancing-star-Patrick-Swayzes-courageous-battle-wife-Lisa.html>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My last words to Patrick? 'I love you,' and those were his last words to me. After I brought him home, things went very fast."</p><p class=dh>Niemi explained that <a class="me a" href=#>Swayze</a> was already in a semi-coma but slipped fully into it late Friday night. They still talked to him and sat with him.</p><p class=dh>She cherished their time alone during which she held his hand, listened to music, slept with her arm around him and her head on his shoulder, all without saying a word.</p><p class=dh>On the morning of September 14, 2009, Niemi looked at Swayze's face and listened to the tiny sips of air he was taking. She noticed something delicate and childlike about it and knew it was time.</p><p class=dh>She did not want to leave the room because she was scared she would suddenly become afraid. Instead, she lay back at his side, held his hand, and felt his pulse again, and then he stopped breathing. Niemi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2080661/Dirty-Dancing-star-Patrick-Swayzes-courageous-battle-wife-Lisa.html>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It was 10 o'clock in the morning. He'd used every last bit of that body and he needed to leave it behind."</p><p class=dh>Niemi and Swayze went through many hardships together.
