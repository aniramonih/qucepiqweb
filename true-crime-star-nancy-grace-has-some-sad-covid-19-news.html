In fact, Grace spoke to NBC's <a href=#>California Live</a> in October 2020 to discuss what it was like to lose someone to the coronavirus. "It's just a shock because our relative, just 10 days before his death, was out working in the yard, blowing leaves and loving life," Grace noted. "And he was a real fighter in life. He just couldn't breathe and finally said 'I just don't have the energy to keep fighting.'"</p><p>"For all the people out there that somehow think masks are a joke or a conspiracy — that's not true," she added. "It's happening. COVID is real."</p><p>Aside from her direct experience with the disease that has killed more than one million people worldwide (per <a href=#>Johns Hopkins University</a>), Grace has also made it her mission to warn people that, even in the midst of all this sickness and death, they are also increasingly vulnerable to scammers. As <a href=#>Grace told Dr. Oz</a> in April 2020, the frontline workers who risk their lives every single day inspired the host to research and write an additional eChapter to her then-forthcoming book <a href=#>Don't Be A Victim</a> to highlight the crimes that have become commonplace amid the nation's economic downturn. From home invasions, to RoboCalls, to fake cures, criminals can hit just as hard as the virus itself, and Grace wants to <a href=#>ensure that no one becomes a victim</a> to COVID-19 in any regard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FlbYJ5e9OrrJ5lk6e2rrGMrKuaql2jrq%2Bv2Gaeq5mTmnqprdJmqqillWLAorCMnKavoZRifnp5zZ6urGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./triple-h-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Triple H Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
