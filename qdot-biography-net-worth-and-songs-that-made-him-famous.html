His mother had her first child outside the marriage, hence, Qdot is the first child of his father and his mother’s second child. His real name is Fakoya Qudus Oluwadamilare, and he is 35 years old.</p><p>Apart from his half-sibling, Qdot is said to have other siblings, but nothing is known about them.</p><p>Qdot completed his secondary school at United Senior High School, Lagos State, and furthered his tertiary education at the prestigious Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), obtaining a degree in General Arts.</p><p>Although born and raised in Lagos State, the artist describes himself as a half Ibadan and half Lagos boy. The environments he grew up in largely influenced his style of music. He got his stage name from the Muslim word Qudus which means The Most Holy. The singer is popular for the music genres – hip hop and Afrobeat, which he uses to create a blend of African and Afrocentric sounds, all centered on the Yoruba language.</p><h2><strong>Qdot Started Singing in 2010</strong></h2><p>Qdot started singing in his secondary school days at United Senior High School but officially began his music career in 2010. Before switching to commercial music, he started by doing rap. However, he decided to go into mainstream music in 2010 with the release of his debut track Story of My Life – the song saw his entrance into the music industry.</p><p>As expected of a debut work, the song introduced him into the music scene but did not give him enough recognition he desired.</p><h3><strong>Qdot’s Songs That Made Him Popular</strong></h3><p>After his debut track, Qdot began working with some notable producers in the industry like D’tunes, Citi Boi, Indomix, and Antras, among others which gave him the needed platform to show the world more of what he’s got.</p><p>Eventually, he rose to prominence in 2013 with his groundbreaking hit Alomo Meta. The song turned out to be a very successful hit, winning him a City People Music Award.</p><p>He followed up the song with a series of strong performances and in 2014 dropped another banger, Ibadan. Having the legendary rapper <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Olamide</a> as a guest artist in Ibadan pushed him to a different level of fame. Following that, in the same year, he released Ibeere (Question) and an accompanying music video produced by HG2.</p><p>With the release of these songs, 2014 was a successful year for the singer, establishing him as an artist on the Nigerian music scene. Continuing to maintain strong consistency and relevance, in 2016, Qdot released Turn Up and La La Lu featuring Lil Kesh. These two songs were party tunes and street anthems that also helped him grow to fame.</p><p>In 2017, he released Apala New School and it got global attention. With millions of views on the streaming platform YouTube, the song gained public attention following its release.</p><p>Qdot has remained one of the most popular indigenous singers in the Nigerian entertainment industry. He has collaborated and shared stages with some Nigerian famous artists such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Olamide</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Davido</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Reminisce</a>, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Patoranking</a>, to name a few. In 2020, he further gained decent prominence and became a force to reckon with in the music industry with the release of one of his biggest hits, Gbese.</p><p>The song is a blend of street slang and Zanku Zanku and had massive airplay across the country.</p><h3><strong>List of Qdot’s Best Songs Include</strong></h3><ul><li>Ijo Gelede</li><li>Ole</li><li>Ah!</li><li>Iyanu</li><li>Moriamo</li><li>Aare</li><li>Origin</li><li>Lalalu</li><li>Breakfast</li><li>Gbese</li><li>Orin Emi</li><li>Afarawe</li><li>Ayedun</li><li>Fuel Subsidy</li><li>Turn Up</li><li>Alomo Meta</li><li>Story Of My Life</li></ul><p><strong>His EP</strong></p><ul><li>Orin Dafidi (PSALMS)</li></ul><p><strong>Studio Album</strong></p><ul><li>Alagbe (201)</li></ul><h2><strong>Qdot’s Net Worth is Mostly Through Music</strong></h2><p>One of the most popular indigenous singers in Nigeria, music is the biggest contributor to Qdot’s net worth of N200 million. He makes money from the proceeds from his singles and album.</p><p>After the success he recorded with his song Alomo Meta, the singer has undoubtedly found his feet as one of the established and successful artists in Nigeria. In addition to that, still in music, he has an official YouTube channel wherein he uploads, promotes, and sells his music.</p><p>He also earns from hosting several concerts and shows. In 2018, he hosted a concert titled “Qdot and Friends” in Ikeja and Ikorodu in Lagos State. The show was organized by Lagos-based music promoter Billy Q Ent and sponsored by Pakotunez and Naijaloaded.</p><p>He also earns from collaborating with other artists. The singer was once featured in one of the biggest Fuji artist’s hip-hop albums My World by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pasuma</a>. He made a guest appearance in the track titled Olohun Oje, which was one of the fan’s favorite hits on the album.</p><h3><strong>Record Label (Business)</strong></h3><p>Before Qdot launched his own label, he was signed to the Omo Ita Entertainment record label. His contract with the music brand expired, and he decided to establish his own. The artist became a businessman following the launch of his imprint, Yorubaboi Music. It is, however, without a doubt that part of his $400,000 net worth was built from being a record label boss.</p><p>Apart from signing other artists, having his own music label lets him keep all the revenues to himself, including the part that unavoidably goes to a record company each time an artist wants to record a song. Even though how much he earns from these sources is not verified, they surely make pillars of his fortune. Meanwhile, the Alo Meta crooner could also have other businesses he runs behind the scene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK570J2mrWWSnryovsCpn7JlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGjsW6%2FzqeerGWkna61ecyam55lmJ66brLApqauq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicola-peltz-actress-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-measurements-husband-net-worth-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Nicola Peltz (Actress) Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Husband, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
