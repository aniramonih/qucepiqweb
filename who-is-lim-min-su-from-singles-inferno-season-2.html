<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Who Is Lim Min-su From Singles Inferno Season 2?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Season 2</strong> of Single’s Inferno just aired on Netflix and contains six episodes so far. Viewers have seen the candidates go on dates to paradise in recent episodes. This week, the popular reality TV dating show welcomed two new contestants, one of them was Lim Min-su, who competed in Miss Korea 2020.&nbsp;Netflix’s Single’s Inferno season 2 distinguishes itself from other dating programs by featuring 12 singletons on a deserted island hunting for their ideal mate. Contestants on the show are not allowed to divulge any personal information about themselves – other than their name – to one other.</p><p>The singletons can only utilize their charm and charisma to win the hearts of people they are interested in. If they are a good match, they will go on a luxury date to paradise and spend the night getting to know one other on a more intimate level. They may also share their age, career, and other personal information in paradise.</p><h2>In Single’s Inferno season 2, Lim Min-su creates drama by choosing to go on a date with Yoong-jae.</h2><p>Lim Min-su, according to her Instagram page, competed in Miss Korea 2020 but did not win the title. On December 31, 2020, she posted a social media post from the Pageant, saying:</p><p>“I’ll never forget the year 2020 when my wishes came true. I hope the next year brings even more wonderful experiences.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lim-Min-su.jpg alt="Lim Min-su" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Min-su is a model who considers herself to be an artist. Her Instagram profile now has roughly 4K followers, but with her presence in Single’s Inferno season 2, that number is sure to grow.</p><p>During her introduction, the Netflix celebrity said:</p><p>“My personality is like an iron fist in a silk glove. People think of me as someone who laughs a lot and has a kind demeanor. But if there’s anything I want to accomplish or believe I should do, I’m a really proactive person. I have a strong preference for guys. So, if I see someone I like, I’m the sort of guy who will go right for him without looking elsewhere.”</p><p>She went on:</p><p>“There won’t be many prospects for me since I’m entering late. So I believe I should hurry up and find someone I like and go after him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lim-Min-su-2.jpg alt="Lim Min-su" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the promo for next week’s episode, Min-su follows through on her promise to go on a date with Yoong-Jae. This creates a lot of drama since Yoong-Jae was chasing Choi Seo-eun, and the two seemed to be happy together.&nbsp;However, the teaser depicts Yoong-Jae smiling and having a good time on a date with Min-su, which upsets Seo-eun. Viewers will have to wait until next week to find out what occurs, when two new episodes will be broadcast.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lim Min-su</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Single’s Inferno Season 2</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuMimZKahnmLAtnnFq6amZaOeu6i4xKxkoqaWmr%2Bvu4ysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-conor-vislay-2-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Conor Vislay?</span></a>
