Later, when&nbsp;Essoe turned 12, she and her family moved to Toronto.</p><p>The actress also occasionally shares throwback pictures of her parents on her social media, while still keeping her&nbsp;family life private. That said, her mother reportedly was a stage actor, whom Essoe grew up watching in rehearsals and productions. Now, it is apparent how she got into acting.</p><p>"Well, my mother was a stage actress for a very long time. I grew up going to the theater with her," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she told&nbsp;Anthem magazine</a> crediting her&nbsp;mother for being the one to influence her towards acting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Young Alex Essoe Attended Drama Classes</h2><p>During the previous interview with&nbsp;Anthem,&nbsp;Essoe further revealed that she attended drama classes from a young age. By the age of 17, she had already played the lead in Medea and did a couple of modeling gigs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Then I found this amazing acting workshop in Toronto with this teacher and it was totally transformative.&nbsp;I quit&nbsp;everything&nbsp;I was doing," she added saying she left her "modeling job" and "boyfriend" to make a career in the film industry.</p><p>After training at the&nbsp;acting school in&nbsp;Vancouver for three years, she made her industry debut in the year 2008, where she starred in short movies and TV shows like Reaper, Free to Go, GHB, and&nbsp;Surviving Crooked Lake. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>With multiple movies and TV shows every year, Essoe has not looked back. She has also been honored at the Fantaspoa International Fantastic Film Festival and is the recipient of the HIFF Award, Festival Prize, and IndieFEST Film Awards.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Who Is Alex Essoe's Boyrfriend? On Her&nbsp;Dating History</h2><p>Since she manages a very secret private life, there have been no details of her boyfriend in the recent past. Not just that, even her relationship status remains unknown amongst her fans.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But like Essoe mentioned in the&nbsp;previous interview that she once left her boyfriend to focus on her career, the cards might not have changed to date, too, as she is still working hard and focused on her career.</p><p>We wish her the best in her career and when the right time comes, may she find her best man. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmcmsVusdKspp5lkp68bq7Osp2roZWjsW65zq%2BgnqtencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-micah-lonell-dickey-atlanta-based-hairdresser-passed-away-tassco.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Micah Lonell Dickey?
