With different incarnations of the titular character changing face so quickly, though, a lot of Whovians are wondering if the Sex Education star’s time in the TARDIS will be as short-lived, but it seems that he’s going to be around for at least two seasons.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent interview with Rolling Stone</a>, Gatwa said that he’s planning to return to theatre next year, but after he’s finished filming “season two of Doctor Who.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Ryan Reynolds would love to get Taylor Swift involved in Deadpool 3, but maybe that’s not the best idea he’s ever had considering her track record</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Taylor-Swift-1989.png><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Taylor Swift and Ryan Reynolds are great pals, and as far as Deadpool is concerned, Miss Americana has had the opportunity to take the costume out for a spin at Halloween, but is that where the two should draw the line? Reynolds has expressed interest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in involving Taylor in the upcoming threequel, but considering her cinematic track record</a>, maybe he should leave well enough alone.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>Listen, we all love Taylor and her music. She’s probably the best songwriter out there right now, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to great cinema. Unless we’re talking about a song for the movie’s soundtrack, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like the one Celine Dion did in 2018</a>, in which case, please, do play on.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>The Last of Us has been nominated for a mind-blowing 24 Emmy awards</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pedro-pascal-joel-the-last-of-us-episode-9-adjusted.jpg><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>In case you were beginning to wonder if The Last of Us on HBO managed to imitate the success of the 2013 video game on which it’s based, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the show has been nominated in 24 categories</a> at the upcoming 2023 Emmy Awards, the first video game adaptation to ever do so. Not only is the Craig Mazin-led television venture up for “Outstanding Drama Series,” but both Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey have received nominations in the respective acting categories.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Let’s face it, folks — this is Naughty Dog’s world, and we’re just living in it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>New Ahsoka trailer casually namedrops Anakin, changes Sabine’s character dynamic, and gives us a first look at Thrawn</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rosario-dawson-ahsoka-tano.jpg><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>There was a lot to unpack in the latest trailer for Ahsoka. Apparently, the Disney Plus series is once again getting into the psyche of its titular heroine, and the trauma she’s endured after the fall of the Republic and the death of her master, Anakin Skywalker. What’s more, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahsoka is now taking on a pupil of her own in Sabine Wren</a>, presumably continuing the character’s lightsaber training. And as if all of these weren’t enough, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the trailer also shows us what Lars Mikkelsen is going to look like</a> as Grand Admiral Thrawn.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Was Kathleen Kennedy fired?
