His impact on the lives of those around him was profound, leaving an enduring legacy of love, compassion, and cherished memories.<b> </b>Prior to the funeral service, a public viewing has been arranged for Monday, February 6, 2023, from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. This time allows friends, family, and community members to come together, offering their condolences, sharing memories, and paying tribute to Quayshon. Facial coverings are required, underscoring the importance of collective safety and respect for one another during these challenging times.</p><h3><strong>Lying in Repose: A Solemn Hour of Reflection</strong></h3><p>On the day of the service, Mr. Williams will lie in repose at the church one hour before the commencement of the ceremony. This solemn hour serves as an opportunity for attendees to reflect on Quayshon’s life, offering a quiet moment of remembrance before the formal proceedings begin.<b> </b>Quayshon Williams leaves behind a tapestry of precious memories that will forever be woven into the fabric of the Auburn community. His memory will be cherished by his three beloved children – Egypt Williams of Lancaster, SC, Safaree Anderson of Flint, MI, and Ava Williams of Auburn, AL.&nbsp;Quayshon’s grandparents, Edward and Brenda Cobb of Loachapoka, AL, held a special place in his heart. His stepfather, Michael Stowe of Opelika, AL, played a significant role in his life. The bond with his biological father, Ronald Maddox of Loachapoka, AL, remained an important connection. Among those mourning his departure are his great-great aunt, Fannie Mae Anderson of Mount Holly, NJ; great uncles Clarence (Mary) Cobb and Michael (Debra) Cobb both of Auburn, AL; great aunt Juanita Cobb of Opelika, AL; and cousin as a great aunt, Cynthia Elaine Smith of Waverly, AL.</p><h3><strong>United in Grief: A Community Mourns Together</strong></h3><p>Quayshon’s impact extended to special cousins who were like siblings: Nadia (William) Rivers, Kadeja Cobb, Mysha Jones, all of Auburn, AL, and Zakaria McCurdy of Opelika, AL. His circle of brothers included Joseph Cobb of Opelika, AL, Kenyata Cobb, Brandon Cobb, all of Auburn, AL, and Monkevin Cobb of Loachapoka.&nbsp;A host of cousins and very special friends join in mourning the loss of a soul who touched the hearts of many. The depth of sorrow is measured by the multitude of lives Quayshon touched and the connections he formed in his journey through life.&nbsp;As the community of Auburn gathers to say goodbye, the shared grief becomes a unifying force. Quayshon’s departure is felt not only by those close to him but by the entire community that mourns the loss of a beloved member. In these moments of collective sorrow, the strength of unity offers solace and a reminder that no one grieves alone.</p><h3><strong>Embracing the Divine Plan: Finding Comfort in Faith</strong></h3><p>While the pain of loss is deeply felt, there is a shared belief that Quayshon’s departure was part of a greater divine plan. Faith becomes a source of comfort, providing the assurance that his spirit continues on a journey beyond our understanding.<b> </b>As we bid a final farewell to Quayshon Williams, let us celebrate the life he lived, the love he shared, and the impact he had on the Auburn community. In the embrace of collective mourning, may the memories of Quayshon bring solace, and may his spirit find eternal peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwvdSasGavmaG5qq3MrGSompmpwqK%2B2Gaeq52jna6uec6rnKCnnmK2r3nLqK2ippdiuqa5zquwZqeWYr62rdhmrqKknJ6urr%2BMnZyarJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carlo-ancelotti.html><span>←</span><span>Premier League club, Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti is married to his wife, Mariann Barrena McClay</span></a>
