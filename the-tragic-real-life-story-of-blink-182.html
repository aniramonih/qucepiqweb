Alkaline Trio guitarist/singer Matt Skiba, with whom <a href=#>Hoppus had been interested in collaborating</a> for years, was tapped to replace Tom at a number of 2015 shows. When the legal intricacies were hammered out with DeLonge, Skiba was added to the band as an official replacement and has been with them ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after, Blink's 2016 release,&nbsp;California,&nbsp;was heavily promoted and was the band's first #1 on the Billboard 200 <a href=#>since 2001</a>. The album sold well and earned the group their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album, but despite glowing reviews for lead single "Bored to Death," the album as a whole received mixed reviews due to its formulaic nature. Then, 2019's&nbsp;Nine&nbsp;debuted slightly lower at #3 but was <a href=#>better received</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As for DeLonge, he's continued with Angels & Airwaves and various other business ventures relating to art and his <a href=#>UFO obsession</a>. For example, To the Stars Academy, Inc. (now known as To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences) is an ongoing project merging various art projects with aerospace engineering projects (yes, really) and UFO truthism. As of October 2018, the project is enduring <a href=#>financial hardships</a> resulting from an inability to crowdfund a starship the company planned to build with, and sell to, the US military. On a lighter note, DeLonge and his former bandmates appear to be on <a href=#>friendly terms</a>, hopefully leaving the door open to future collaborations.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bj3BucHBfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dl7mquspmaHFqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamanna-roashan.html><span>←</span><span>The make-up artist Tamanna Roashan teaches beauty classes in DressYourFace Live.</span></a>
