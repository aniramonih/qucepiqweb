<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>American TV Host Sara Haines and her hubby Max Shifrin blissful marital status! Also know about thei</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><i>The View</i> co-host <strong>Sara Haines</strong> became a mom for the third time in 2019. Haines gave birth to a baby boy together with her husband <strong>Max Shifrin</strong>.</p><p>The couple is together for more than five years now. Born in Iowa, her charming and peppy personality makes her audience fall in love with her. And maybe that's why her hubby also fell in love. Let's know more about their married life.</p><h2>The Private Wedding</h2><p>In an interview with <i>The Brides</i>, Haines explained she had no idea whether Max is the one or not at that time. The pair went out for one date and with initial spark, the duo started seeing each other more often.</p><p>After nine months of staying together, Max proposed Sara with Haines saying Yes to his romantic proposal. The couple walked down the aisle on November 22, 2014, in a private ceremony. There are not many details about the wedding as the married couple decided to not disclose much about the nuptials.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/25/Wedding-1569389165189.jpg><h2>OkCupid Started their Love</h2><p>After living a single life for many years, Haines had enough. Following her other single friends, Sara decided to enter the digital dating field. She lives in New York City where Haines could meet so many people but as she remembers that was not the case for her.</p><p>With a little bit of help from her brother and her best friend, Haines tried dating online via <i>OkCupid</i>. It is a free dating site where you don't have to pay for an annual membership. Sara wanted to use it mostly because of that as she did not want to feel pressure in using it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/25/Event-1569389484104.jpg><p>Nearly after weeks of setting up a profile, Haines received a message from Max Shifrin. After some back and forth, they decided to meet but Sara had to cancel the first date because of her work.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Second Date</h2><p>Even after their first date got canceled, Max persisted in meeting Haines. He messaged her again and they decided to go out for a drink. Haines came prepared with her brother just in case the date does not go well.</p><p>After some conversation, Haines brother and his boyfriend came around and it became a group date. The couple hit it off very quickly and the conversation went on and on. They stayed for dinner that night and even after-dinner drinks. &nbsp;</p><h2>"We did it!!!", Sara Haines</h2><p>On March 5, 2016, Haines gave birth to the couple first child together. <a href=# rel=nofollow>She announced the birth of her son Alec Richard Shifrin</a> via a social media app <i>Periscope</i>. The pair named their son after their dads' name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/25/Sandra%20child-1569389772790.jpg><p>Haines said,</p><p>"We did it!!! We are excited, exhausted, and possibly still in shock, but soaking it all in. Thank You for the encouraging words. It will take a village to raise this little man:)".</p><p>Her Television host and friend <strong>Amy Robach</strong> advised her to tell the whole world through her Morning news program. Haines did not expect that answer at all but everyone rejoiced the blissful moment in her life.</p><p>Not just that, On December 24, 2017, the couple announced the birth of a second child, a daughter via Instagram. <strong>Sandra Grace</strong> is the child name and even though the birth of their children is a blessing, the couple stayed real on social media.</p><p>Haines and her hubby Max never wrote on social media about how it was the best day of their lives. Instead, the pair went,</p><p>"We're in shock, really tired, and getting to know him!".</p><p>The Television host remembers, how the day was very depressing and hard and hormonal.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alec and Sandra; make way for your Brother</h2><p>Yes, the <i>Good Morning America third-hour</i> co-host is on maternity leave after giving birth to her third child. Sara and her spouse welcomed their third child, a son <strong>Caleb Joseph</strong> on June 26, 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/25/Third%20child-1569389913694.JPG><p>The pair announced the good news via Haines Instagram. All of their family and friends especially her co-host <strong>Michael Stratan</strong> and her colleagues <a href=#>Lara Spencer</a><strong>, </strong><a href=#>Claire Shipman</a><strong>,</strong> and <a href=#>Spencer Christian</a> to name a few sent heartfelt messages upon the birth of Caleb.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Keke Palmer will join Michael as co-host in the daily show.</a> Upon Keke arrival, the fans are also very excited. They are sending messages saying all the fun things about the new host.</p><p>For further updates, keep reading <a href=# rel=nofollow>MarriedCeleb.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpqYq5ldna6qusSsZJqmlGK1tr%2FBmqWdZZ2WxW6%2Fx6Kdq6GeYrqivtGinJ1lnJ6zpg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazon-late-delivery-refund.html><span>←</span><span>Amazon Late Delivery Refund (2023 Guide)</span></a>
