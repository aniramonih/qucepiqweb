Wayne Dyer was born on May 10, 1940 in Detroit, Michigan. He spent most of his childhood in orphanages and foster homes. The fact that he had tough childhood is underlined in his speeches where he uses his own experience to teach people how to reach success. His message is focused on the fact that everyone can be successful if one remains faithful to their Higher Self. Dyer graduated from Denby High School and enlisted to the Navy in 1958 where he served for four years. He holds a Doctorate in Educational Counseling obtained in Wayne State University. Dyer was a High school counselor at Detroit and served as a professor of counseling in St. John¬¥s University in NYC. In campus, he would deliver lectures on motivation and happiness.</p><p>Persuaded to publish his work and noticing the success these would have, he quit the teaching job to promote himself across the United States. His success took him to major prime time shows where he presented his work. He has written over 30 on self-help and motivation. "10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace" became a New York Times bestseller. Dr. Wayne Dyer is often referred to as the "father of motivation" given the content of his lectures which he combines with some spirituality and a somewhat religious view. Dyer travels around the world delivering his uplifting message. He presently lives in Maui, where he writes most of his work. Dyer has been married three times and has six children, one from his first marriage and five from the third. He separated from his third wife in 2001, but remains legally married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHy4rdinnGacqZq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./treach-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Treach Age, Wikipedia, Biography , Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more</span></a>
