Lynlee Jo Gallatin wedded Benjamin Renick in 2014, and the couple lived respectively with their girl and her child from a past relationship.

Then, at that point, Lynlee conversed with Michael, an ex, about assisting her with disposing of Ben, and he concurred.</p><p>Ashley and Michael later asserted they helped Lynlee in light of the fact that she affirmed Ben was physically harmful. Thus, on June 8, 2017, Michael and Lynlee headed to Ben’s rearing office to kill him. During Lynlee’s preliminary, Michael professed to hear a discharge and said he saw her with a firearm in her grasp.

Lynlee said she went there to converse with Ben in regards to separate and had Michael with her for help. She said, “I strolled up right behind Michael, and afterward Michael pivoted, and I saw a weapon in his grasp, and I shouted and ran outside.” Then, Lynlee expressed she rushed to the vehicle and accepted something brutal happened when Michael came later and encouraged her to get into the vehicle.</p><p>Where could Lynlee Renick Now be?
