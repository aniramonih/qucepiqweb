Per&nbsp;<a href=#>Autopsy Files</a>, the report specified that Goldman was stabbed multiple times with a sharp object, and the gruesome details demonstrated just how depraved his murderer was. Goldman endured stab wounds nearly everywhere — he had injuries to his neck, face, ears, chest, thigh, hands, forearm, and abdominal area. The autopsy report highlighted that while some of these injuries would've been non-fatal, the stab wounds to his neck and torso were what ultimately led to his death. The coroner noted that there was damage to a major neck vein, as well as his lung. The internal bleeding that Goldman had in his abdomen also left critical wounds.</p><p dir=ltr>But the report did show that Goldman did not die without a fight. The autopsy explained that Goldman had dozens of defensive wounds, mostly found on his hands, face, and upper body. These discoveries mean that he fought hard to live.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDj3Jwa3Ffmba0wNSrm6ilkZ67oIOMnZytmZmhwG6yzq6lnWWZo3qzu81mnqiklKKur7%2BMmqytp6Coxm6%2BxKmmq6xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-neil-patrick-harris-play-in-that-70s-show-html.html><span>←</span><span>Did Neil Patrick Harris play in That 70s Show?</span></a>
