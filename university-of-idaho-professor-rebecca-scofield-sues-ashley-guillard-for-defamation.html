The victims were found on the second and third floors, while two female roommates on the first floor slept through the attack, according to police.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Here’s the latest coverage on the brutal killings of four college friends:</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The lawsuit alleges</a>&nbsp;that Guillard started posting on Nov. 24 and directly blamed Scofield, stating that the professor “had been involved in a relationship with one of the murdered students, K.G. [Kaylee Goncalves].”&nbsp;</p><p>“On or about November 28, 2022, Guillard posted six TikTok videos to her account in which she falsely stated that Professor Scofield, the chair of the history department, was responsible for the four students’ deaths,” the lawsuit said. “Two of the TikToks directly and falsely state that Professor Scofield ordered the execution of the four students. Three of the TikToks either falsely implied or directly stated that Professor Scofield had been involved in a relationship with one of the murdered students, K.G.”</p><p>Scofield started working at the university in 2016 and took the position of department chair in 2021, according to the Idaho Statesman. In the lawsuit, it states that Scofield was in Portland visiting friends at the time of the killings and had never taught or met any of the victims. &nbsp;</p><p>“She fears for her life and for the lives of her family members,” the complaint states. “She has incurred costs, including costs to&nbsp;install a security system&nbsp;and security cameras at her residence. She fears that Guillard’s false statements may motivate someone to cause harm to her or her family members.”</p><p><a href=#>Moscow Police have yet to name a suspect</a> and have had to dedicate time to helping control the rampant rumors and theories that have circulated due to the murders. The police have even included a section in regular press releases called “Rumor control,” aimed at quashing rumors about the murders, victims or possible perpetrators that spread online.&nbsp;</p><p>Officials have warned&nbsp;that law enforcement officers have been monitoring rumors on social media and noted in a Dec. 9 press release that “[a]nyone engaging in threats or harassment whether in person, online or otherwise needs to understand that they could be subjecting themselves to criminal charges.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtma2xfqruqwsSrqqKsqWK8p3nInZihp12lv7CyxKyqqKpdp7KjscKcmGark6SzqrHLnWSsrZWoeqK%2Fx6WcsmWXqratuMCrm2aen6d6pbHFmqSarJmku3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-williams-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler Williams Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
