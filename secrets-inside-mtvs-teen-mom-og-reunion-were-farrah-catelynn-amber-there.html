Meanwhile, <a href=#><strong>Amber Portwood</strong></a> found out she was pregnant, while <a href=#><strong>Maci Bookout</strong></a> dealt with her newly sober ex&nbsp;<strong>Ryan Edwards</strong>.</p><p>Abraham, who <a href=#>has been replaced</a> on the show by <i>Teen Mom 3</i>’s <a href=#><strong>Mackenzie McKee</strong></a>, is <a href=#>currently suing Viacom</a> for $5 million, claiming the company &nbsp;“wrongfully terminated her employment because she did not conform to gender stereotype.” While the <i>My Teenage Dream Ended</i> author, 26, had exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i> that she <a href=#>would not be</a> attending the reunion, it was up in the air whether or not her parents would be there.</p><p>“Farrah’s mom did make an&nbsp;appearance at the reunion. But [Farrah] wasn’t there, nor her dad,” an insider tells <i>Us</i> exclusively, before adding that Deborah was “surprisingly rational and calm.” It doesn’t seem like Abraham regrets her choice not to attend either — she is currently in Los Angeles and shared a pic on Instagram on Saturday with her new boyfriend, <strong>Aden Stay</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Portwood, who is expecting her second child with boyfriend <strong>Andrew Glennon</strong>, was not able to attend the filming due to “vomiting related to her pregnancy,” according to the source,&nbsp;but she did film a segment via satellite.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One person who did show up was Lowell, who <i>Us Weekly</i> also <a href=#>revealed would be</a> making a rare appearance at the reunion amid her recent&nbsp;mental health struggles. The <i>Conquering Chaos</i> author, 25, left home to seek treatment <a href=#>for a third time</a> in January&nbsp;after she admitted she was considering committing suicide.</p><p>“Catelynn was there and is doing so much better,” the source said. “Treatment benefitted her tremendously.”</p><p><i>Teen Mom OG </i>airs on MTV Mondays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqem6KawbR5yKeqopyVYrq1wtJmq56dnmK6sLmMqJ5mqpWqu6q7zWaunqqVYrOivtGan2abkamyrcXNp2SapZKav27Ax56pnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tasya-van-ree-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Tasya van Ree Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
