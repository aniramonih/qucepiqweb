According to reports, Pinnix was offended by something the tourists said, which led to the incident.</p><p>The altercation swiftly gained widespread attention and was accused of racism. Numerous people questioned Pinnix’s views and motivations as a result of her actions and her hurtful remarks.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind, though, that this episode might not be enough to categorically classify her as racist.

Her termination was justified by a “zero-tolerance policy around prejudicial or discriminatory behavior,” according to the statement.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>social media personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>What Happened To Wentworth Miller’s Hair, And Is He Now Bald?
