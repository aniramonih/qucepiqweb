Bryce Mitchell is one of the most exciting fighters on the UFC roster. He has an impressive record as a featherweight, with six wins and one loss in the UFC. Mitchell has great grappling skills to overpower most featherweight fighters.</p><p>His highlight moment came when he knocked down <strong>Edson Barboza</strong> before dominating him on the mat. Mitchell’s grappling threat opens the room for striking, which could cause problems for most fighters. For those who didn’t know, what makes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryce Mitchell</a> so interesting remains his persona – he moonlights as a fighter, and his full-time job is farming. If that wasn’t enough to win people over, he also raps in his free time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Apart from being an endearing person to observe, Bryce Mitchell is also a top-grade MMA fighter, with only one defeat in the UFC at 28 years of age. That being said, he has not peaked yet and could make a title push in recent years as he approaches his prime.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Bryce Mitchell’s girlfriend, Erin Handlow?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryce-mitchell-net-worth-202-4><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryce_Mitchell_Net_Worth_2024></span><strong>Bryce Mitchell Net Worth 202</strong>4<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His estimated net worth of $1.5 million is not just down to his fights – he is a full-time farmer, which certainly brings him good revenue. However, the cherry on top is his multiple endorsements, including those with MyBookie and Jocko Fuel, making him a millionaire. As his star grows, he is expected to earn more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bryce-Mitchell-1024x768.jpg><p>Mitchell has expected earnings of $50,000 per fight, which he earned in his featherweight bout against Edson Barboza. In his fight against <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ilia Topuria</a></strong> at UFC 282, he earned just as much – add onto that any fight of the night or performance of the night bonuses, and his payday could reach around $100,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryce-mitchell-s-mma-career><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryce_Mitchells_MMA_career></span><strong>Bryce Mitchell’s MMA career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mitchell’s persona was built on the ability to give to the fans a working man’s fighter – that is, he is honest to the core, says it like it is, and gets the job done without much of a fuss. And his MMA career reflects just that, with his impressive record in the UFC – his record stands at 15-1. Before entering the UFC, he had bouts in V3 Fights, AXS TV Fights, and WSOF.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bryce-Mitchell-fighting.jpg><p>The UFC and its scouts have a special knack for scouting talent at the grassroots. They were quick to get him to The Ultimate Fighter, where he, unfortunately, lost in the quarterfinals. However, he bounced back to win six straight in the UFC.</p><p>In his career, Mitchell submitted <strong>Matt Sayles</strong> with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nasty maneuver</a>. He has notable wins over <strong>Charles Rosa</strong>, <strong>Andre Fili</strong>, and Edson Barboza, where he wrestled away to a decision victory. However, surging contender Ilia Topuria countered Mitchell’s wrestling at UFC 282 and handed Thug Nasty his first professional loss in his career. Mitchell will aim to bounce back in his next fight and get back to his winning ways.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryce-mitchell-s-girlfriend><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryce_Mitchells_girlfriend></span><strong>Bryce Mitchell’s girlfriend</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It seems like Mitchell is a man who enjoys his peace in life – that is, apart from his usual shenanigans on the farm and outings in the octagon, we rarely know any other details about the fighter’s personal life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bryce-Mitchell-and-his-girlfriend.jpg><p>That being said, he has uploaded pictures with a woman by the name of <strong>Erin Handlow,</strong> who is his partner. The two seem to share responsibilities on the farm and have a couple of dogs alongside other domestic animals. Handlow worked numerous jobs as a marketing professional before meeting Mitchell.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryce-mitchell-s-gym-and-coach><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryce_Mitchells_gym_and_coach></span><strong>Bryce Mitchell’s gym and coach</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being an Arkansas native, it only makes sense for Mitchell to train out of the state where he enjoys his farming responsibilities. Mitchell trains out of Barata MMA under the guidance of coach <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rudy McGlothlin</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Bryce-Mitchell-and-his-coaching-team.jpg><p>Being a humble fighter at heart, Mitchell has chosen to surround himself with the right team to keep him grounded, with its base as close to him as possible, which is integral to his functioning at the top. He puts in the work as suggested by his coaching team and always remains cordial with them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryce-mitchell-s-injuries><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryce_Mitchells_injuries></span><strong>Bryce Mitchell’s injuries</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Perhaps one of the most famous aspects of the Bryce Mitchell lore is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous injury</a> he once suffered while partaking in physical labor. As he told the story himself, while working with a power drill, he managed to rip his scrotum and seriously injure his modesty. Welp, that has got to hurt!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Q_1670523513-1024x576.jpg><p>However, a testament to UFC fighters – they are some of the toughest people on the planet. The incident occurred in August 2018. In 2020, it was reported that the Arkansas native had suffered yet another injury – fret not, UFC fans! It was a broken hand he sustained after beating Andre Fili. A broken hand, but not as gnarly as the aforementioned story. Injury troubles have kept Mitchell out of the octagon regularly. Hopefully, his health will improve as he approaches his prime.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-faqs><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQs></span>FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>How much is Bryce Mitchell’s net worth?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Bryce Mitchell is worth approximately $1.5 million.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Has Bryce Mitchell ever lost in the UFC?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Yes.
