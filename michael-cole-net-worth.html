For his higher education, he attended the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, earning his bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism in 1988.</p><h2 id=journalism-career><strong>Journalism Career</strong></h2><p>After graduating from Syracuse, Coulthard became a journalist for CBS Radio. His first high-profile assignment was covering the 1988 US presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. For the next presidential election cycle in 1992, he covered the campaign of eventual winner <a href=# title="Bill Clinton Net Worth">Bill Clinton</a>.

Using the stage name Michael Cole, he started out by doing voiceovers for promotional videos. That June, he made his first appearance onscreen in an episode of "Raw is War," and subsequently replaced Todd Pettengill as a backstage interviewer. Later in the year, Cole became one of the three announcers during the first hour of "Monday Night Raw," alongside Kevin Kelly and <a href=# title="Jim Ross Net Worth">Jim Ross</a>.

Although he was seldom involved in professional wrestling storylines, Cole did have brief roles in storylines with Heidenreich, Vito, and D-Generation X. In 2006, Cole's broadcast partner Taz left SmackDown, and was replaced by <a href=# title="John Layfield Net Worth">John Layfield</a>.

Also in 2010, Cole began a feud with Lawler. After the feud ended, he continued to wrestle, mostly favoring heels. Despite having served as a heel commentator since 2010, Cole showed his compassion in a September 2012 episode of "Raw" when his partner Lawler had a heart attack on the air. He continuously provided updates to viewers on Lawler's condition, and earned praise for his class and professionalism in handling the emergency. Cole went on to join in commentary during various "Raw" and pay-per-view events.
