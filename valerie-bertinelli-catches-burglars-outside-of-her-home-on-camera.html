"We've had a string of robberies in my neighborhood, my next-door neighbor included," she wrote. She also theorized that the man wandering up her driveway suddenly stopped because he noticed the light on her camera. According to the "Hot in Cleveland" star, the men were not together when she spotted them on her property but arrived an hour apart. "F***ing scary," Bertinelli wrote.</p><p dir=ltr>It's unclear which of her homes Bertinelli was at when she noticed the alleged thieves. In August, <a href=#>Dirt</a> reported that she had listed her Hollywood Hills ranch house for sale, but she also owns properties in Malibu and Studio City.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Bertinelli revealed that she contacted police and they searched her property. However, it seems that the suspicious men were long gone by that time. "I'm installing more motion detector lights and thinking of putting barbed wire on my front fence and of course my alarm gets set every night," the actor wrote on her Instagram Story. Security expert Jeff Zisner told <a href=#>Fox News</a> that another action celebrities can take is to be extra careful about what they post on social media — thieves can use photos and videos to map out potential targets' homes and figure out when the residences are unoccupied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamllZn91hI6vmKWdop6ybq7Eq6uippWhuap5wpqrnKCVqHqjwdGgo5qqo2K8tsDSopueZZ%2Bbeqmx0WafqKWVYryvecKapJ6qkWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./104964-us-singer-halsey-welcomes-first-child-boyfriend-alev-aydin-html.html><span>←</span><span>US Singer Halsey Welcomes First Child with Boyfriend Alev Aydin</span></a>
