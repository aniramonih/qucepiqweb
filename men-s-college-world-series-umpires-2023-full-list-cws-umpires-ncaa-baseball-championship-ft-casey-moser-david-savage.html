Let's dive into each of the eight.</p><h2>College World Series umpire: Ramon Armendariz</h2><p>Ramon Armendariz is an umpire for the Western Athletic Conference and the Pac-12. He has been able to climb the ranks and make it as an umpire for the 2023 CWS after being an official for more than 25 years.</p><h2>Angel Campos</h2><p>Angel Campos is a name some people may remember as he was an MLB umpire for a while as an alternate for the league from 2007-2012. He made a comeback with the league in 2014 but now focuses more on the college game than the pros.</p><h2>Brandon Cooper</h2><p>Brandon Cooper has some of the most tenure on the College World Series officiating team as he has been an umpire since 1999 at NCAA events. He is an author and businessman as he is leading True Officials that provides sporting goods to umpires in all sports.</p><h2>Jeff Head</h2><p>Jeff Head is one of the most experienced umpires on the CWS crew as he umpired in the 2011, 2014 and 2017 College World Series. He is an umpire for the Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference, so he has the experience. Head is also an instructor at the Umpire Placement Course since 2020.</p><h2>Casey Moser</h2><p>Casey Moser has officiated in many different scenarios, being part of a fill-in role with MLB and part of the 2006 World Baseball Classic. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>College baseball</a> fans should know his name as well as he is one of the most well-known umpires in the sport.</p><h2>Travis Reininger</h2><p>Travis Reininger has worked all levels of the minor leagues and even was a fill-in Major League Baseball umpire before settling into college baseball. He was part of the 2006 World Baseball Classic umpiring crew as well, so he has been around the block and will not be overwhelmed here.</p><h2>David Savage</h2><p>David Savage is in his first CWS, despite working in college baseball for more than 20 years. He is an umpire for the ACC and SEC and has been on the field for a lot of significant moments throughout the year.</p><h2>Billy Van Raaphorst</h2><p>Van Raaphorst was in the headlines during the NCAA Tournament in the Knoxville super regional for ejecting Tennessee outfielder Drew Gilbert during a game. He is one of the more strict umpires in the College World Series. He is the brother of former NFL quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst, so the sports world is in his blood.</p><h2>Backup umpires</h2><p>The College World Series has backup umpires if one of these eight is not able to perform their duties. The alternates are Linus Baker, Perry Costello, David Uyl, Mike Morris, Mile Jarboe, Greg Street and Shawn Rakos.</p><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false; modalPopup.setHeader("Why did you not like this content?"); modalPopup.setContentText(modalText); modalPopup.addCancelOkButton("Submit", resetRatingAndFeedbackForm, sendRating); modalPopup.removeCloseModalIcon(); modalPopup.disableDismissPopup(); modalPopup.open(); } else { sendRating(index); } } function sendRating() { var requestPayload = { "post_id": 1556770, "rating_value": ratingValue } if (ratingValue > 3) { requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = null; requestPayload.rating_feedback = null; } else { if (!$('input[name="drone"]:checked') || !$('input[name="drone"]:checked').value) { showErrorMessage('option'); return; } if (!$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea") || !$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value) { showErrorMessage('note'); return; } var selectedOption = $('input[name="drone"]:checked').value; var feedbackNote = $(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value; requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = selectedOption; requestPayload.rating_feedback = feedbackNote; } pureJSAjaxPost(addratingAPI, requestPayload, onsaveRatingSuccess, onsaveRatingFail, function() {}, true); } function resetRatingAndFeedbackForm() { var activeStars = Array.from($all('.rating span.rating-star.active')); for (var i=0; i &lt; activeStars.length; i++) { activeStars[i].classList.remove("active"); } if ($('input[name="drone"]:checked')) { $('input[name="drone"]:checked').checked = false; } var userNote = document.querySelector(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea"); userNote.value = ''; modalPopup.close(); } function onsaveRatingSuccess() { modalPopup.close(); savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie(); $("#post-rating-layout").classList.add("hidden"); $("#post-rating-message").classList.remove("hidden"); window.setInterval(function showMessage() { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.add("hidden"); }, 3000); } function onsaveRatingFail() { console.error('Saving post rating failed!'); modalPopup.close(); } function savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie() { userRatedPostIds.push(1556770); var expiryTime = new Date(); expiryTime.setMonth(expiryTime.getMonth() + 12); // Expiry after 1 year setCookie("user_rated_post_ids", JSON.stringify(userRatedPostIds), expiryTime); } function isPostRatedByUser() { var userRatedPostIds = getCookie('user_rated_post_ids'); if (userRatedPostIds) { try { userRatedPostIds = JSON.parse(userRatedPostIds); } catch (err) { console.error(err); return false; } } else { return false; } if(userRatedPostIds.indexOf(1556770) >= 0) { return true; } else { return false; } } function getRatingCountByPostId(postId) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { pureJSAjaxGet( getRatingCountBaseURL + postId + '/rating/count', function(data) { try { data = JSON.parse(data); if (data.meta_value) { resolve(data.meta_value); } reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } catch (err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } }, function(err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); }, true); }); } function showErrorMessage(messageType) { var messageContainerId = '#' + messageType + '-error'; $(messageContainerId).classList.remove('hidden'); window.setInterval(function () { $(messageContainerId).classList.add("hidden"); }, 5000); } (function() { var callFired = false; function lazyLoadPostRating() { if (callFired) return; callFired = true; if (!isPostRatedByUser()) { getRatingCountByPostId(1556770) .then(function(ratingCount) { if (ratingCount &lt; 10) { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.remove("hidden"); } }) .catch(function(err){ console.error(err); }); } } document.addEventListener("scroll", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("mousemove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("touchmove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaJufobmms8RmmZqrlZeurbiOppynZaNisLC4y56enmWnpL%2BtsIysnKuhlah6trnPoqmeq11nfXN%2FjJ%2BspaRdoba0wIycrqxlpaK9qr7ErGSnm5GWeqOt0p6ZmqScYrCprcypoKimo522sXnFrWScmaOaxm65zqycq2WUlsOqsIysmK%2BZl5o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fergie-net-worth-207934.html><span>←</span><span>Fergie Net Worth</span></a>
