When asked about the longstanding history between himself and Kenny Omega, Moxley touched upon their rivalry beginning back at the very first AEW pay-per-view, Double or Nothing.</p><p>“When me and Kenny entered each other’s spheres, AEW was just beginning,” Jon Moxley said. “Tony was sitting at my kitchen table telling me about this theoretical TV show that might exist and this theoretical promotion that might exist.</p><p>“Now, four years later, we&nbsp;just sold 60,000 tickets&nbsp;to a country we’ve never been to without a match announced. There is definitely pride for those of us who’ve been here since the beginning. I don’t know if you want to call me and Kenny the definitive rivalry, but it’s important. The cool thing is, this is four years later and we just sold 60,000 tickets to Wembley f—ing Stadium.”</p><p>Despite how it’s currently being portrayed on television between <a href=#>The Elite</a> and <a href=#>Blackpool Combat Club</a>, Moxley admits he greatly respects Omega and The Young Bucks.</p><p>“I have an immense amount of respect for Kenny and the Young Bucks,” Jon Moxley said. “We’re blades looking for iron to sharpen ourselves. That’s true. I want to challenge myself against the three of them.”</p><p>Moxley and Omega have had many memorable matches against one another, and it certainly sounds like this Wednesday night will be no different, judging by Mox’s comments.</p><p>“Another thing me and Kenny have in common is that no matter how our bodies feel, when people give us their time and money, we put it all on the line,” Jon Moxley said. “We just don’t know any other way to do it. The BCC vs. The Elite, this rivalry is the absolute apex of professional wrestling right now. We’re going to have a great crowd and we have the steel cage. It’s got all the ingredients for a really memorable night.”</p><p><a href=#>Jon Moxley: Mentally And Physically, This Is The Best I’ve Felt In A Long Time</a></p><p>What do you make of Jon Moxley’s comments?
