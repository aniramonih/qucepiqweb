Maurice was admitted to have an intestinal blockage removed, but suffered a heart attack during the operation.</p><p id=eFLT-arN_ofr data-wc=47>He briefly regained consciousness on Saturday, to open his eyes and squeeze his daughter's hand, but the 53-year-old was unable to pull through. He was surrounded by his wife Yvonne and their two children, along with brothers Robin and Barry, when he passed away on Sunday morning.</p><p id=eJbFitWkb2bw data-wc=34>"We will pursue every factor, every element, every second of the timeline, of the final hours of Maurice's life," said Barry. "We will pursue that relentlessly. That will be our quest from now on."</p><p id=edzD0FkB2BhW data-wc=22>Hi passing marks the end of an era for the legendary trio, who are the fifth biggest selling artists of all time.</p><p id=eV9DaExjIslJ data-wc=38>"It is with great sadness that we regretfully announce the passing of Maurice Gibb this morning," said a statement released by his family. "His love and enthusiasm and energy for life remain an inspiration to all of us."</p><p id=eWzt4N0ianUR data-wc=70>Tributes have been pouring in from showbiz heavyweights. Louis Walsh, who manages Maurice's former wife Lulu, said: "There was so much more to the Bee Gees than just Saturday Night Fever. People don't realise they wrote songs for the likes of Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand. To me Maurice Gibb was a more important songwriter than Burt Bacharach or Hal David, As songwriters, they are up there with the Beatles."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
