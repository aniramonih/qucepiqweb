Five months after the youngster made her way into the world on <strong>4 November 2014</strong>, her proud father<strong> shared a sweet snapshot of his baby girl </strong>on with David Letterman. "Congratulations! We have another baby, this is a little girl," the host told Robert.<strong>"Yes, we have a daughter named Avri,"</strong> replied the star. "I have three kids now, I have a 21-year-old named <strong>Indio</strong>, I have a three-year-old named <strong>Exton </strong>and now Avri who is now a little over five months.<strong>"I thought I'd show the first picture on planet earth here with you kind sir,</strong>" he added.

No rivalry?""No, not yet," responded the New York-born star, laughingly adding: "I mean it's natural for Exton to want to bite her every once in a while and it can start off as a little pet and it turns into a nibble. "The chatshow host was keen to reassure the actor that children "have a way of figuring it all out.""They do," replied Robert.
