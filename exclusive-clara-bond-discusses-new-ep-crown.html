The record is being led by the hit single ‘Does Your Girlfriend Know You’re Single’.</p><p></p><p><strong>How excited are you to be so close to sharing your new EP?&nbsp;</strong><br>I’m really excited for it to finally be out and for people to be able to listen to it. We’ve been working on it for a year and it’s all I’ve been able to talk about or think about. I’m excited to crack on with the next stage and release the damn thing.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little about the inspiration behind the record?</strong><br>Each song is a different subject matter. ‘Does Your Girlfriend Know You’re Single’ is the first song that I wrote for the EP and ‘Pink Wine’ is the last track. It’s about growing up and the small flaws that make up relationships, all those imperfections that I have to talk about now I’m that bit older.</p><p><strong>What was the overall writing process like for this EP?</strong><br>Actually the most fun of any of the EPs, two of the songs I wrote with the other band members so I really felt at home. I didn’t have to try very hard to get something that felt unapologetically me.</p><p><strong>Is there one song, in particular, you’re most excited about sharing?&nbsp;</strong><br>‘Pink Wine’ for sure, it’s a song that made it into the EP at the 11th hour, but when we finished writing it, Ollie and I stepped back and went ‘whoah, ok.’ It was the most fun track to record, the first guitar solo that I have in a song, it just feels absolutely amazing. It’s the first song I’ve written that I don’t feel guilty boasting about, and I don’t feel conceited when I say it’s good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you hope fans take away from the record?</strong><br>I hope that people get what I’m going for. I hope they have a little bit of insight into the way I work as a writer and musician and how I’m trying to make music that doesn’t sound like everyone else or so that people say ‘wow, that sounds just like Nashville.’ I hope they connect with the songs. I think if you try and chase the bandwagon, you’re always going to be behind it. This is the first EP where I really haven’t cared about what other music is coming out right now, I’m just going to make music that’s my own.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the overall vibe of the EP?</strong><br>It’s cool, it has a nostalgic feel to it.</p><p><strong>Can we expect to see you playing the record live soon?</strong><br>Yeah, follow my social media and my <a href=#>website</a> for all those details.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you follow Clara Bond on Twitter<a href=#> @ClaraBondSongs</a> to keep up to date with all her latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with Clara Bond?
