Ross was an undrafted free agent for the Chiefs back in 2015, which looks to be when he and Travis first became pals.</p><h2 id=h-ross-travis-s-history data-injectable=false>Ross Travis’s history</h2><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>Ross went on in 2017 to be claimed off waivers by the Indianapolis Colts, where he played for two years, however, his 2018 season was cut short when he tore a ligament in his knee (which sounds incredibly painful) during a game. He stayed on injured reserve for a while and he was waived by the team at the end of 2019. After that, Ross went on to play for the New York Jets, Arizona Cardinals, and the Cleveland Browns. He is currently an undrafted free agent with the Detroit Lions.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Anyways, through all of that, he and Travis Kelce have remained pretty tight; Ross frequently shows up to support his buddy at his games, and he was even in the same box as Taylor cheering his friend on from the sidelines at the Super Bowl. The two are also often seen working out together and just generally hanging out.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=false>Ross is obviously very close with his football buddy, he’s comfortable enough to be a third wheel around Taylor and Travis and have it not be weird. The trio are seen together pretty frequently and there’s even a picture of Ross and Taylor posing for a photo on his Instagram account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBs63Voqpmo5WhsKa%2FjJucrKxdm7%2Bqsc2dZKuno6h6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-chrisley.html><span>←</span><span>Todd Chrisley- Bio, Wiki, Ag, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Relationship</span></a>
