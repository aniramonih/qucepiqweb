Lavin is an American BMX rider, television host, and musician who has a net worth of $4 million. T.J. Lavin earned his fortune as a sponsored dirt jumper and BMX rider. He has also secured a number of endorsement deals throughout his career and hosts the MTV reality show series "The Challenge." Lavin is widely regarded as one of the greatest BMX riders of all time.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Thomas Joseph Lavin was born on December 7, 1976, in Las Vegas, Nevada. He first began riding bikes when he was just two years old. T.J. started to take it more seriously around the age of 15, and at 19 years old he won his first pro contest. In addition to his riding, he also taught himself how to play piano and later built a recording studio in his home.</p><h2 id=bmx-career><strong>BMX Career</strong></h2><p>T.J. Lavin started racing in events such as the X Games and the Dew Tour. And in the X Games, he won bronze three times, silver once, and gold three times (one Australian). Lavin has been a DK Dirt Circuit Champion, a Gravity Games champion, a European championship winner, and a CFB Champion. In 1995, he was crowned the "King of Dirt."</p><p>In October 2010, Lavin was competing in a Dew Tour event in Las Vegas when he crashed and was rushed to the hospital. He sustained critical injuries and had to be put in a medically induced coma and developed a case of pneumonia shortly after. Later that month, it was reported that T.J. was once again breathing on his own and able to follow simple commands such as giving a thumbs-up or squeezing a hand. Doctors said he was expected to make a full recovery, and he returned home in November 2010.</p><p>In October 2022, T.J. Lavin was inducted into the USA BMX Hall of Fame.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-253063 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/GettyImages-463985994.jpg alt="What is T.J.
