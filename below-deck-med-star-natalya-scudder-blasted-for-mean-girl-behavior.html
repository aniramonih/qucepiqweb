The current season of Below Deck Med has been hard to watch with the constant bickering between Natalya and chief stew Tumi Mhlongo.
Things went from bad to worse in the most recent episode, prompting Captain Sandy Yawn to have a talk with them.
Although Tumi tried to squash the beef and talk to Natalya, the latter brushed her off until the next day."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
