I have no words.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_143>In February 2019, shortly before Nipsey Hussle’s death, the pair was featured in <a href=#>GQ</a>. Lauren spoke about how she admired Nipsey Hussle’s work. “He’s gotten more of a platform to be really clear about his message, because before he was just making rap gang-bang music. But I think he has a purpose in all the raps, and that’s coming to light,” she told GQ. Nipsey Hussle admired London’s choice to put family ahead of work when she got pregnant with their son. Instead of accepting a television role, she decided to reject the offer and focus on her family. “Lauren was handpicked by John Singleton to do Snowfall. She read, got the part, shot the pilot… did stunts… this was her dream role,” he said. “And then she got pregnant with our son. That was a really hard decision for her to make.”</p><p id=par-6_24>London and Nipsey Hussle also appeared in a video that accompanied the GQ article.
