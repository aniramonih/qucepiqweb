The game is more popular than ever, with fans all over the globe tuning in to see the stars compete.

That's the richest deal the NBA has ever seen.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Harden isn't far behind – the Rockets star signed an extension this off season worth $228 million over six years. At the time, it was the highest contract in NBA history.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-233715 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-632039312.jpg alt width=900 height=561 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-233715 class=wp-caption-text>Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And who did Harden overtake (albeit briefly) for the richest deal in the league? Golden State's Curry, who, unlike Westbrook and Harden, re-signed instead of signing an extension. That distinction doesn't mean much, other than Curry is finally being paid what he's worth – $201 million through the 2021-22 season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curry's previous contract was for $44 million over four years. Last season, he wasn't even among the four highest-paid players on his own team, let alone the league.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Don't expect this trio to be the only ones raking in the big bucks, either. There are plenty of young stars on their second contracts that could be due for max extensions when their current deals are up. With the new "supermax" extension in play, stars on a rookie extension who are still on that same team – think Portland's <a href=# title="Damian Lillard Net Worth">Damian Lillard</a> or Washington's <a href=# title="John Wall Net Worth">John Wall</a> – could be eligible to make 35 percent of the salary cap.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Curry's deal – an average of $40 million per year – is a great example of the potential earnings a superstar can make. And who knows? Maybe in a couple of years, the salary cap will have ballooned even higher and players will be flirting with $50 million per season. As long as the game is flourishing globally, that remains quite a realistic possibility.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqemsGWknb%2BmsYypo5qxlafAbrrBmmScp56pv6Kv06xksKeiqbVufo9pZKahnKG2sLqMoKyaqpGjwaaxw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-truth-about-jennifer-hudsons-husband-and-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Jennifer Hudsons Husband and Marriage</span></a>
