Katelynn Heil from Moonbug Entertainment, the company that coordinates Blippi, spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a> about the character and Kaitlin.</p><p>"All of us are excited about the addition of Meekah to the franchise," she said. "Kaitlin Becker, who plays her, could not be more phenomenal. We met her about a year and a half ago when we were thinking of bringing a female cohost to the brand. She’s got experience in edutainment, and she’s a mom herself. Audiences immediately responded to her, and some fans even dressed up like her for Halloween."</p><p>Based on the success of Meekah, more characters are bound to be added to the Blippi universe over the next few years. Who's going to join the crew next? Season 1 of Meekah is available to watch on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmnZWgrql5zqdkm6SZpb2q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-do-i-put-in-my-fondue-burner.html><span>←</span><span>What do I put in my fondue burner?</span></a>
