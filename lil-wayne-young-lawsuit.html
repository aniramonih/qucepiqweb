The alleged wronged business partner of the deal, Carter, and his counsel, highlight that signed agreements showed the labels' profits and ownership would be split by a nearly equal margin of 51%-49% between Lil Wayne and Universal, but the term of this agreement finally expired in June of last year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-154829 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wayne1.jpg alt="Ethan Miller/Getty Images" width=594 height=416 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-154829 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><p>On the subject of fair sharing and Drake's upcoming album, Carter's attorney, Howard E. King, argues that Universal should respect Lil Wayne for all he has done for the company instead of seizing profits. Carter's court documents state:</p><p style=padding-left:30px>"Universal has claimed a right to 100% of the label performance royalties attributed to YME Records," while claiming a second defendant in the case, SoundExchange, "refuses to pay any of the money due to Young Money LLC and Carter individually based on Universal's conflicting demand."</p><p>Universal Music Group, on the other hand, says that the entire lawsuit is without legs, vehemently denying any claims of wrongdoing.</p><p>A rep for the group told the Hollywood Reporter:</p><p style=padding-left:30px>"We don't intend to dignify this with further public comment except to say that we will vigorously contest it and that the merits of our case will carry the day."</p><p>Still, the Young Money founder is asking the court to make Universal hand over at least $40 million in both damages and profits, coupled with a final judgment declaring each parties' respective rights in sharing loyalties, particularly those earned by way of performance.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-187033 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GettyImages-177314935.jpg alt="Lil Wayne and Birdman" width=594 height=402 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-187033 class=wp-caption-text>Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for BMI</p><p>Another court case initiated by Lil Wayne targeting Cash Money and co-founder Bryan "<a href=# title="Birdman Net Worth">Birdman</a>" Williams continues to be pending in a Louisiana federal court. This separate $51 million lawsuit claims that Cash Money refused to pay both Carter and third parties involved with Young Money Label, all while improperly registering copyrights so they don't&nbsp;reflect the joint ownership between both labels.</p><p>There is no word on whether these potential court battles will have an effect on the release of rapper Drake's highly anticipated new album, Views from the 6, due out sometime in April.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC4yKVksJmpo7Juxc6upaBlnJbEtMHIrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-bibby-in-jail-wiki-net-worth-age-arrested-girlfriend-brother-son.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Bibby in jail?
