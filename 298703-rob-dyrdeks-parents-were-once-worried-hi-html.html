With his savvy branding, he has made Gene and Patty Dyrdek part of his universe of ridiculousness.</p><p class=dh>MTV personality Rob Dyrdek has incorporated his mom Patty Dyrdek's disapproval of him dropping out of school to become a professional skateboarder at 16 into his mythology. Both parents have been featured on his various prank and extreme sports shows.</p><p class=dh>His mom has an Instagram following of 119K at the time of writing, which is quite impressive for someone whose sporadic posts mainly focus on her family and garden. The skater's fan base is all over her comments; one asked Pat to write a parenting book because she wanted her kid to turn out just like Rob.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Rob Dyrdek's Parents Are Supportive in Their Own Way</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>If Patty, a homemaker, and suit salesman Gene, could have plotted their son's career path, he would have gone to college and had a white-collar job like an accountant. Their son <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mensjournal.com/adventure/rob-dyrdeks-tv-empire-of-fun-20141003/>describes </a>them as grounded, hardworking Middle Americans:</p><p class=dh>"If my parents really understood how much I've learned that I could never learn in school, they'd be very proud. Instead, I'm still their crazy kid, sagging his pants and dancing around on the laptop."</p><p class=dh>And while they might not understand, his mom cried when she discovered that her son's MTV show, with its dangerous stunts and pranks, had been renewed. They support him, but Pat warns him to stop telling podcasters he is a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfV2jSz7XIE">high school dropout</a> because people will think he is a loser.</p><p class=dh>Gene played golf, or at least his<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRcfdFSgrGp/?hl=en"> son's version</a> of the game, on season 9 of "Ridiculousness" and made an appearance with his wife the following year on an episode titled "Rob's parents."</p><p class=dh>Rob's mother was the wide-eyed star of one of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3609095/>first episodes </a>of "Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory" in 2009, aptly named "This Is Not Mom Certified," with Gene, and a few more episodes and bonus materials through the show's decade run on MTV.</p><p class=dh>Pat mourned <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BT8EITYAK-o/>the death</a> of her son's collaborator Chris "Big Black" Boykin, who called her mom when he passed away on May 9, 2017, saying he would always have a "special place" in her heart. Big and her son co-created and starred in "Rob & Big" on <a class="me a" href=#>MTV</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Gene & Patty Dyrdek Are Still Together after over a Half Century of Marriage</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>On January 22, 1966, a 21-year-old Patty married veteran Gene, who was 24. For their "going away outfits" after the wedding, the bride wore a stylish <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUH1ElJA54T/?hl=en">houndstooth ensemble</a>, and the groom looked dapper in his three-piece suit. They also have <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2234521/bio>a daughter</a> named Denise.</p><p class=dh>In 2015 Gene survived a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BCUC53oBGag/>heart attack</a> but had to have two stents put in. He was back in the hospital during their 50th wedding anniversary two months later for surgery related to lung cancer. The romantic organized 50 roses and asked the nurses to decorate the room.</p><p class=dh>The couple still loves celebrating their wedding anniversary after 50-plus years together, most often at their favorite steakhouse in Dayton, Ohio, the Oakwood Club. Rob and Bryiana gifted them first-class tickets to Hawaii, the Florida Keys, or Bermuda.</p><p class=dh>A photo of their 54th anniversary in 2020 drew disbelief from Pat's following, who could not believe that she was old enough to have been married that long. One well-wisher <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://www.instagram.com/p/B7plJa_HdIa/?hl=en">praised </a>the septuagenarians for looking "so happy and healthy."</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Gene, a keen golfer, shattered his wrist after tumbling on the second hole of the golf course.</strong></h3><p class=dh>A fan of their son, who is now also an admirer of the devoted Christian pair, complimented the grandmother on her lengthy hair, noting that she must be aging in reverse, and asked Pat to adopt her. The hopeful adoptee also said that Gene looked like a greying Fabio.</p><p class=dh>Rob gave his mother the ultimate experience by organizing her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4237520/?ref_=nm_flmg_eps_tt_1">cameo </a>on her favorite soap opera, "The Bold and Beautiful," in 2014. Pat portrayed an assistant named Robin, who talks back to Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) and interacts with Heather Tom (Katie Logan).</p><p class=dh>The skater shared a video of her performance and another of him running lines with her on Mother's Day 2020. The one-time soap star's son <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CABJi7hntCJ/?hl=en">said </a>that he would not be the person he is today if he was not raised with so much love and understanding by his mother:</p><p class=dh>"I put her through so many things that either upset her or made her wonder what she did wrong that I turned out so crazy. She's been a willing and unwilling participant in so many of my wild adventures."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Gene & Patty Are Now Doting Grandparents and Remain Active</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Gene, a keen golfer, shattered <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkeIB1vg4jj/?hl=en">his wrist</a> after tumbling on the second hole of the golf course in June 2018, which called for surgery with a plate and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpqTggYj4Gr/?hl=en">nine screws</a>. The grandpa, then 81, was back beating his son Rob on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTaRy-8vJ5W/?hl=en">the green</a> by putting an eight-footer in September 2021.</p><p class=dh>The elder Dyrdeks are blessed with three grandkids, Kodah and Nala Dyrdek and Mason Lunsford. The salesman fixed up their son's battery-operated mini motorcycle for Mason when he was 19 months, who rode <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/2USzlHhGQy/?hl=en">in circles</a> under the watchful gaze of his grandparents.</p><p class=dh>The enthusiastic grandma has one other baby love in her life, her pampered <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BgsKlaqA7Rf/?hl=en">rescue pup</a> Maggie, which she dresses up with pink bows. Pat supports her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CPHwVoEho-g/>daughter-in-law</a>, <a class="me a" href=#>Bryiana Dyrdek</a>, and her Iconic Beauty brand.</p><p class=dh>The granny of three grieves the end of summer when she can no longer sit on her front porch overlooking a flower garden and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWZABmivdRi/?hl=en">artificial ducks </a>and chat with the neighbors.
