Teen Mom OG stars <strong>Catelynn Lowell</strong> and <strong>Tyler Baltierra</strong> have been cherishing every moment with their baby girl <strong>Novalee Reign</strong>, whom they welcomed on New Year’s Day.&nbsp;</p><p>And now that the little one is nearly 4 months old, she’s starting to show some real personality. On Monday, April 20, Lowell, 23, shared a split shot with her fiancé and daughter making similar goofy faces via Instagram.</p><p>“She is his twin @tylerbaltierramtv,” the proud mom captioned the cute picture.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>While the pair have been posting endless pictures and videos of their little girl on social media, their story line on Teen Mom OG revolves around their restrictions in sharing images of their first daughter <strong>Carly</strong>.</p><p>In the premiere season of Teen Mom OG, Carly’s adoptive parents <strong>Brandon </strong>and<strong> Teresa</strong> made it clear that they don’t want photos of their daughter on Twitter, Instagram, or any other platforms — a point that’s been hard for Baltierra to accept. In the April 20 episode, he noted that they have a fear that Brandon and Teresa won’t let the reality stars visit Carly any more if they cross a line.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It would take a lot for that to happen, so let’s be clear and open about that,” Brandon said, reassuring the young parents. “There’s that same feeling on our side, because you’re always going to be her birth parents, and we are never going to be her birth parents. Someday she may want to have a relationship with you as adult-to-adult, which is hard for us.”</p><p>For now Lowell and Baltierra are content in sharing their new treasure Novalee with their fans, posting several videos of the cutie on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>“She loves her momma,” Lowell wrote along with one clip of the baby girl wriggling on the carpet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJqarJWhxq%2B6jKWmsJ2coXqxtM6tpmasp567tHnTsqOeql2Xrq3AyJ6pq5ldo7y3rcuenGZqYGaCc32T</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brenda-hampton-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Brenda Hampton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
