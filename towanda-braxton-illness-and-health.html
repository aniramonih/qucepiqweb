cancer.</p><p>Instead, she has lately been remembering her late sister Traci Braxton, who passed away from esophageal cancer, with affection and honoring her life.</p><p>Towanda posted messages on social media to honor Traci’s courageous battle against this condition and to show her respect for her sister’s fortitude and tenacity in the face of hardship.</p><p>However, in response, there have been rumors of potential conflicts amongst family members around pictures that one Braxton sister uploaded online.</p><p>Towanda urged them to take advantage of those possibilities for mending rather than letting the negative fester and promoting sustained harmony among family members.</p><p>Her behavior exemplifies how important it is to uphold the family link in order to preserve memories and relationships for generations to come.</p><h2><span id=Disease_of_Towanda_Braxton>Disease of Towanda Braxton</span></h2><p>There are no current reports of sickness involving Towanda Braxton.</p><p>She shaves off all her hair after observing Tracy lose all her hair due to chemotherapy, which is a selfless act of love and sympathy towards Tracy.</p><p>This gesture of support was tremendously motivating and demonstrated Towanda’s willingness to sacrifice everything to help Traci get through the difficult times.</p><p>The fact that she decided to maintain her bald head after tragically losing Tracy just serves to highlight how much she values her sister’s memories.</p><p>Towanda kept Traci’s comments, encouraging the lifelong decision, close to her heart when she said how beautiful she looked with a shaven head.</p><p>It is crucial to have access to exact information on people’s health state.</p><p>There haven’t been any signs of Towanda Braxton’s illness as of yet (in
