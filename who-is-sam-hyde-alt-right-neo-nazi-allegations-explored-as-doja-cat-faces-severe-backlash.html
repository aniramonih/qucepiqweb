Hyde is known for espousing homophobic, racist, and neo-Nazi ideologies online. Following the backlash, the rapper promptly removed the photo from her social media account. However, despite her efforts to rectify the situation, Doja Cat continues to receive criticism online.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Sam Hyde?</strong></h2><p>Sam Hyde, also known as Samuel Whitcomb Hyde, has gained notoriety for his involvement in terrorism hoaxes. Following his completion of one year at Carnegie Mellon University, Hyde transferred to the esteemed Rhode Island School of Design, where he successfully obtained his degree in 2007.</p><p>It was during the mid-2010s that Hyde rose to prominence within online circles, primarily due to his dissemination of offensive stand-up comedy material that targeted the LGBTQ+ community and various racial groups. Notably, he deceitfully claimed responsibility for several significant shootings, including the tragic incidents in Parkland, Las Vegas, and Orlando, among others. Consequently, Hyde‚Äôs actions led to his association with a humorous meme, 4Chan in 2015.</p><p>Hyde, one of the founders of the sketch comedy group ‚ÄúMillion Dollar Extreme,‚Äù has gained notoriety for his public support of alt-right and neo-Nazi organizations. His supposed comedic writings have been criticized for their use of racism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism. Additionally, Hyde is a well-known figure in the boxing world.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite being widely read, various social media posts have mistakenly identified Hyde as the culprit behind the murder of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022. These misidentifications were due to a manipulated photo that depicted Hyde as a woman using the name Samantha Hyde. It is important to clarify that Hyde had no involvement in the Covenant School massacre, as falsely claimed.</p><h2><strong>Alt-Right Neo Nazi allegations explored&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Since the debut of tracks such as ‚ÄúDemons‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaint the Town Red,‚Äù which have been associated by some with Satanic inspiration, Doja Cat, known by her birth name Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini, has become a highly polarizing figure in the music industry. In March 2020, she garnered criticism after expressing on Instagram Live that COVID-19 was merely akin to the common flu and that she harboured no fear towards it.</p><p>Furthermore, her attendance at Kendall Jenner‚Äôs Halloween and birthday gatherings in October of that same year, amidst the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, drew considerable backlash.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚ÄúSAM HYDE SHE REALLY IS FOR THE CULTURE‚Äù</p><p>The culture in question: <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/5S7wXjQi34</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/Wa9MXFZWj9</a></p><p>‚Äî constantly giants ~ #1 WORST TEAMüò≠üò≠ (@takenusername80) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">October 7, 2023</a></p><p>Doja Cat has recently come under fire for sharing a controversial photo on Instagram, which she has since deleted. The photo showed her wearing a tiara, bedazzled eyebrows, and small hoop earrings while sporting a black t-shirt featuring an image of Sam Hyde holding a gun and scowling at the camera.</p><p>Despite removing the photo, she faced significant backlash online, and in July 2023, during a Threads discussion, she made a statement that she did not value her followers, which only added to the negative response. As a result, she lost over 250,000 Instagram followers.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Doja Cat‚Äôs shirt with Sam Hyde in full. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/7p2lvGnHPT</a></p><p>‚Äî Juice Pop (@TheJuicePop) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">October 7, 2023</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8CmZKGxlJp6orjTZqmin5ipeq%2BxzmalmrKZYq6tuMSgmK2hn6PAbrHXqaOoqpWZeqK%2FjJ2mo5ldmK61ecWamp6rXaiyt7HRnmSbmZOguaK%2Fx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-glaser-and-her-husband-matthew-green-martial-status.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Who Is Nikki Glaser's Sister Lauren Glaser?
