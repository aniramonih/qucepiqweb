My dream job as a kid was to be an Imagineer at Disney World.</p><p>3. That ’70s Show was my first audition. A classmate’s parents were producers and saw me in a school play.</p><p>4. I’ve never broken a bone.</p><p>5. My first concert was Guns N’ Roses at the Hartford Civic Center [in Connecticut].</p><p>6. My single biggest honor was getting to do a voice on The Simpsons [in 2008].</p><p>7. I was chosen to be a juror on a murder trial but had to be excused when the defendant recognized me!</p><p>8. My hobby is editing [film].</p><p>9. Nobody thought I could play David Duke in [2018’s] BlacKkKlansman. I made a tape to prove it to <a href=#><strong>Spike Lee</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Topher-Grace-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-Inline-2.jpg><p>10. I went to boarding school for five years.</p><p>11. Each year, my wife [<strong>Ashley Hinshaw</strong>] and I host the annual CASA gala to support youth in the Los Angeles foster system.</p><p>12. I collect fake movie posters that are in [real] movies, like Jaws 19 from Back to the Future Part II. I’m currently hunting for Scorcher VI from Tropic Thunder.</p><p>13. Growing up, <a href=#><strong>Chloë Sevigny</strong></a> was my babysitter.</p><p>14. Before I had kids, I had a Monopoly group, the way some guys have a poker group.</p><p>15. I got to be part of casting Home Economics, so I am fanning out on set every day.</p><p>16. I’ve only done one professional play, Lonely, I’m Not by <strong>Paul Weitz</strong>. It taught me more about acting than anything else I’ve done.</p><p>17. Up until last year, my parents lived in my childhood home. If I was filming nearby, I would stay over and sleep in my old bunk bed.</p><p>18. I used quarantine to binge <a href=#>Breaking Bad</a>.</p><p>19. I was freaked out to do Irresistible [in 2020] because <a href=#><strong>Steve Carell</strong></a> was starring in it [and] <a href=#><strong>Jon Stewart</strong></a> was directing [it]. My all-time favorite show remains The Daily Show when they were on it.</p><p>20. In [2014’s] Interstellar, <a href=#><strong>Christopher Nolan</strong></a> didn’t tell me that <a href=#><strong>Jessica Chastain</strong></a> was going to kiss me in the last scene. My reaction is the one they used in the movie.</p><p>21.

I am the world’s worst cook. Fortunately, my wife is amazing at it.</p><p>23. As a teen, I got a job at Suncoast Motion Picture Company because I thought I could watch movies all summer. They only [played] one the whole time… and sadly [it] was Space Jam.</p><p>24. I [took] ballroom dancing classes with <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a> for [2003’s] Mona Lisa Smile. Her greatest acting challenge to date was [pretending] like it didn’t hurt when I stepped on her toes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I dropped out of college to take my first acting role.</p><p>Home Economics airs on ABC Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp6CdsrN5xquYnJ1dZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adele-grammy-martin.html><span>←</span><span>Top night for newcomer Adele as she becomes a Grammy winner</span></a>
