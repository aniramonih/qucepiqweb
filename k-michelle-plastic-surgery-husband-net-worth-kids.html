Michelle is an American singer-songwriter who charted singles with Fakin’ It and Can’t Do This. She is also well-known as a former star on the reality series Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta.</span></p><p><span>Her birth year differs in several outlets, and she is believed to be 39 years old as of 2021, which makes her born in 1982. She was born in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. She has honed her skills in the music world ever since she was a child and further pursued music which led her to become one of the prominent personalities in the music industry.</span></p><h2><span><strong><strong>Rumors Of&nbsp;</strong></strong></span><span><strong>K. Michelle Undergoing Plastic Surgery</strong></span></h2><p><span>When it comes to plastic surgery, K. Michelle has been very open about it and revealed about her troublesome journey. After installing faulty butt implants, she went through the process of removing the hazardous mass from her body to help restore her natural shape.</span></p><p><span>While she may have admitted her body enhancements, her new social media post has made the fans think that she may also have undergone some facial alterations. In June 2021, she took to her Instagram and Twitter page to share a photo of herself, which accumulated a mass response from fans saying that she looked beautiful, whereas some pointed out her noticeably different face, calling her <strong>“unrecognizable.”</strong></span></p><p><span>As the rumors of her going under the knife to alter her face spread, many social media users compared her to reality TV star Moniece Slaughter.</span></p><p><span>Prior to this rumor, she has said since 2018 that she had been working to remove silicone from her body sustained from her illegal butt injections. She said she had four surgeries to remove botched <strong>“black market”</strong> silicone butt injections. For five years, the injections posed no problems. But in 2017, Pate began to experience fatigue, migraines, and back and leg pain. Later, doctors found that the silicone had spread down her legs, <strong>“damaging her tissue and threatening her overall health,”</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE </a>reported.</span></p><p><span>Then, she consulted a doctor, who recommended trying liposuction to remove the silicone in January 2018, but it further spread the silicone in her body. So, a few weeks later, she was rushed to an emergency room, where she had to get two blood transfusions. And, in April 2018, she had three more surgeries to remove dead tissue.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/k-michelle-before-and-after.jpg alt="k michelle before and after" width=650 height=487 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>K, Michelle before and after plastic surgery (©: GlamourBiz)</strong></span></p><p><span>Michelle announced she had undergone reconstructive surgery to remove the black market hydrogel injections from her body. In pictures shared on Instagram in June 2021, Michelle rocked her natural curves in a thong, free of any cosmetic changes.</span></p><p><span>In 2020,<a href=# rel=noopener> she warned other women</a> against making the same mistakes she did.<strong> “Woman, I’m not playing with your body. I don’t care if you’re telling me that. Injections are illegal for a reason,”</strong> she said.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth And Career Of K. Michelle</strong></span></h2><p><span>K. Michelle has become a prominent personality in the music industry through her endeavors. With her relentless efforts in her professional career, she has an estimated net worth of $2.5 million as of 2020, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>CelebrityNetWorth</a>.</span></p><p><span>K Michelle has an unusual talent that she can boast about. She can yodel, which is a very useful talent for the artist. She also once earned a music scholarship with her yodeling during an audition at Florida A&M University, which further pushed her to pursue a music career.</span></p><p><span>Michelle began her music career in 2009 by signing a deal with Jive Records. She then released her first single,&nbsp;Fakin’ It, that captured a fair amount of audiences. The following year, she released three singles, namely Fallin’, How Many Times, and I Just Can’t Do This, which peaked at numbers 56, 53, and 53 respectively on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.</span></p><p><span>In 2012, she starred in the reality show Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. She signed a contract with Atlantic Records in 2013 and simultaneously released her first studio album named Rebellious Soul in August of that year. This album debuted at number 1 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 2 on US Billboard 200 chart.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, she joined Robin Thicke for the Blurred Lines Tour. She also started her own TV show K. Michelle: My Life, around November that same year. The following year, she collaborated with Keyshia Cole for My Twisted Mind Tour. During 2015, Michelle also became part of reality shows Love & Hip Hop Live: The Wedding, Punk’d, and L.A. Hair.</span></p><p><span>Some of the albums she has released include More Issues Than Vogue, Kimberly: The People I Used to Know, and All Monsters Are Human, to name a few. As a talented artist, K Michelle, throughout her career, has been nominated for four BET Awards between 2014 and 2016 and won a Soul Train Award in 2014 and an NAACP Image Award in 2014.</span></p><h2><span><strong>K. Michelle Married Life And Kids</strong></span></h2><p><span>With the real name Kimberly Michelle Pate, K Michelle is married to Dr. Kastan Sims, though it doesn’t seem to be clear when they are married. The couple was facing some marital issues for some time. During the last of 2020, Michelle revealed via social media that a woman had messaged her to tell her that her husband, Kastan, was having an extramarital affair and was trying to blackmail her.</span></p><p><span>In the moment of distress, the singer took to Twitter to vent out her frustration. In a series of tweets, she also revealed that she was experiencing stress due to her career and family life.</span></p><p><span><strong>“I have constant hate mail no matter how hard I try to help my community,”</strong> she said in a now-deleted tweet. <strong>“I have people showing up at my home to get video footage of me. I got a girl black mailing me 4 money telling me my husband is cheating on me, he’s mad @ me for talking 2her, my grandma just had a stroke, I got people trying 2 stop my cancer, I have people making fun of my surgery & health, I have a random dude I never slept with lying on me.”</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>“I just can’t do it anymore,”</strong> she added. She continued to send out tweets detailing her weariness with the way she feels she’s treated. And after deleting the tweets, she didn’t address the matter again.</span></p><p><span>The two have been friends for over 20 years and have known each other since high school, according to the singer’s interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Essence</a> in 2017. However, after being pretty quiet about her love life with Sims during 2018, the fans even raised more eyebrows at their relationship after her caption on a post about the wedding ring.</span></p><p><span>The singer took to Instagram in October of 2018 and shared a promotional feature about herself. She wrote, <strong>“Pinky Ring till I get a wedding ring.”</strong> However, fans with extraordinary intellect decrypted the caption as the possible worsening relationship between Michelle and Sims.</span></p><p><span>Prior to this post, in August of 2018, Michelle retorted at the public talk of separation of her from her husband Sims, saying that they are still together. She further added that she has not got any new man and told the people to drink some<strong> “positive juice.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The pair started dating in 2015. During an appearance in 2020 on ABC Radio, she shared that she had a difficult relationship with her husband, Sims. In 2019, the couple made headlines after revealing plans to start a family with the help of a surrogate. Michelle, at the time, decided to entrust Tonai – who previously carried triplets – with her embryos. However, the situation has unraveled dramatically since the time.</span></p><p><span>Later, in a conversation with her lawyer, Michelle complained about her arrangement with Tonai, who she initially picked up because she loved<strong> “how she takes care of her kids.”</strong> But later, the surrogacy was found out about the whole public because of a YouTube video posted by Tonai announcing the fact. And it further complicated the things between them as Michelle wasn’t happy about it.</span></p><p><span>Michelle later revealed in August 2018 that she just might be ready for more babies as a doctor had deemed it possible for her to have a <a href=# rel=noopener>baby without needing a surrogate</a>.<strong> “Guess who was FINALLY given the go-ahead to carry my own babies? ME!”</strong> Michelle announced with an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram post</a> during the time. <strong>“Man, it’s been a journey. No surrogate needed. Embryos can come out the freezer.”</strong> She added: <strong>“It feels like Christmas, I’ve been so scared! Babies and business, LIFE AINT THAT BAD.”</strong></span></p><p><span>They last made the rounds in September 2019, when Michelle attacked one of Kastan’s patients on social media. While the pair have been on the hush-hush tip about their relationship, K Michelle set the record straight about where they stand. <strong>“I mean, we going through issues, you know. I think things could be better,”</strong> she tells <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC Audio</a>.<strong> “We always think the grass is greener on the other side too, so I’m just trying to field through that and make sure I’m doing the right thing.”</strong></span></p><p><span>K Michelle came out as bisexual during Season 6 of<strong> Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta</strong>. Soon&nbsp;after, she got involved with one of her co-stars, Melisia. However, it all changed when Michelle cold-heartedly informed her ever-enthusiastic admirer that their romance would never enter into a state of bloom. Before Melisia came along, the singer went out with basketball players like Bobby Maze, J.R. Smith, and Lance Stephenson.</span></p><p><span>Michelle also formerly dated actor Idris Elba. Michelle and Elba first met at the 2013 ceremony, where Michelle <a href=# rel=noopener>initially rejected Elba</a>. But later, Elba got her number through her bodyguard and started messaging each other. The two met up in Los Angeles, and the rest became history as they had a private 8 months relationship in 2014 and separated.</span></p><p><span>K Michelle has a son named Chase Bowman from her previous relationship. She is further looking forward to increasing her family size with plans to welcome some children.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46kZKahk52yrbjEZqelmaOptqR50q6poJ2irnqpwdKbmKecXaOytXnWqKmtoF2gtqW%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rich-homie-quan-bio-wiki-age-family-wife-songs-albums-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Rich Homie Quan Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Wife, Songs, Albums and Net Worth</span></a>
