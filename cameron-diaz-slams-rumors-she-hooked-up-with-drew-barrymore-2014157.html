<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>Cameron Diaz Slams Rumors She Hooked Up With Drew Barrymore</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Bwahaha! <strong><a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> </strong>laughed off rumors she’s been intimate with BFF <strong><a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a></strong> in an interview with <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. Stunning on the August 2014 cover, the Sex Tape actress told the magazine when confronted about the rumor, she said it made her want to “vomit.”</p><p>The rumor mill started after Diaz admitted in an interview with <a href=#>Glamour UK</a> in May that “all women have been sexually attracted to another woman at some point.” The actress, 41, then went on to admit to <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live that yes, she’s “<a href=#>been with a lady</a>.”</p><p>But it wasn’t best friend Drew Barrymore!</p><p>“I don’t even pay attention. People will always speculate. People like scandal. They like to put a label on something that they don’t understand. It makes them feel comfortable,” Diaz told the mag. “Mostly they like to guess who it could be,” she added.</p><p>“Some media outlet called for a comment and they wanted to know whether I was with Drew,” Diaz said of her Charlie’s Angels costar, 39, who recently welcomed her second child with husband <strong>Will Kopelman</strong>. “Literally, I said, ‘That makes me want to vomit in my mouth.'”</p><p>“That’s like saying I’m having sex with my sister. Are you crazy? I wouldn’t even ménage with her!” the blonde exclaimed. Diaz, however, isn’t close-minded when it comes to her own sexuality. “Everybody tries things and sees things and checks them out, and either walks away or walks further in. It’s life — it’s what people do. I’m not going to tell people what I’ve done, but I’m also not going to say, ‘No! I would never!’ If I said that, I’d be shaming myself and shaming other people’s choices. I don’t want to add any stigma to someone’s choice.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=581 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="cameron diaz harper's bazaar subscriber cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the time being, The Other Woman actress is content with boyfriend <strong><a href=#>Benji Madden</a></strong>.
