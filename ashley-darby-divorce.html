She told<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Bravo</a> in a statement,</p><p>Michael and me planned to spend every waking moment together. Sadly, that is not how things stand right now. We’ve reached an agreement to go our separate ways. We realize there will be many unsubstantiated assumptions made about our decision.</p><p>Reality television’s intrusion into our private lives, generational differences, cultural norms and parental styles will all be blamed. She explained that while these factors may have each played a role, no single factor was ultimately responsible for their decision to part ways.</p><p><strong>You can see the official confirmation of her split from Michael in the Instagram post that she posted on April 20, 2022:</strong></p><p>Now that we’re both well into our 30s, we’re at entirely different points in our lives with entirely different plans for the future. It’s something we both want for the other, but we know we can’t have it if we’re together. Ashley continued,</p><p>While our romantic bond is broken, we will always love and respect each other. We’ve learned the hard way that the key to a happy life is a committed partnership and so we’re putting everything we’ve got into being the best parents we can be to our two sons, Dean and Dylan. Because they were made with love, they will never feel alone or unsupported.</p><p><strong>If you want to know about the latest news related to the divorce of other celebrities, you can read our previous posts:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Does Ashley’s Divorce Settlement Include Alimony?</strong></h2><p>Andy Cohen, the host of The Real Housewives of Potomac, questioned the 34-year-old reality star about the status of her prenuptial agreement with her ex-husband in a sneak peek for the upcoming season 7 reunion. <strong>Ashley Darby implied that she would receive no alimony payments from their estranged husband Michael Darby.</strong> (according to information found at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pagesix.com</a>)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ashley-Darby-Divorce-1.jpg><p>The news completely shocked her coworkers.
