He is currently a full-time boxer and entrepreneur.</p><h2><span id=Childhood>Childhood</span></h2><p>John Gabbana was born in Florida as John Robert Hill Jr, although his actual date and year of birth are uncertain. Simona Ariel and John Robert Hill Sr. raised him in a black ethnic family. His mother gave him the moniker Boonk, and he grew up in Jacksonville with several siblings. His parents are divorced, and he had a stepfather called Dirk Marshall Williams Jr, who died of cancer when he was 14 years old. When he was born, his mother was a teen mother.

In the meantime, he was employed at Miami International Airport. He quickly gained a great deal of success and recognition.

His social media and musical careers, on the other hand, took a nosedive after he shared inflammatory films on several social sites.</p><p>He has since rehabilitated his career and works as a professional boxer as well as owning a merchandising company called Shop Gabbana.
