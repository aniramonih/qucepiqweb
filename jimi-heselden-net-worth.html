Jimi Heselden was born James William "Jimi" Heselden on March 27, 1948 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. At the age of 15, Heselden left Osmondthorpe Secondary Modern School to work as a laborer and then at collieries in Temple Newsam and Lofthouse. He lost his job in the wave of layoffs that followed the 1984‚Äì85 miners' strike and spent his severance check on renting a workshop to set up a sandblasting business.</p><p>He soon got to working on developing and patenting a collapsible wire mesh and fabric container, now called Hesco bastion, to be used for building flood management and to limit erosion.In 1989, Heselden founded Hesco Bastion Ltd to manufacture containers of the same name; filled with sand or earth, they quickly found favor with the armies of several countries, as they allowed effective blast walls, barriers and revetments to be quickly constructed. Made in Hesco's factory in Leeds, these were shipped in great numbers to conflict zones, including Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan as well as later being used for flood defenses in New Orleans, Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. He died on September 26, 2010 after the Segway he was riding plunged off a cliff and he fell 80 feet into the a river.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97yaKkomWYmsCmuMOepWamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-simpson-latest-appearance-see-through-rhinestone-gown-sparks-questions.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jessica Simpson's latest appearance in see-through rhinestone gown leaves fans with questions</span></a>
