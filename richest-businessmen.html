Joe earned his fortune as the founder of 84 Lumber. He also owns the popular Pennsylvania resort, Nemacolin Woodlands Resort.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Joseph A. Hardy III was born on January 7, 1923. He was raised during the Great Depression and sold fruit door-to-door during college. After graduating with a degree in industrial engineering from the University of Pittsburgh Hardy opened up the Green Hills Lumber Company.</p><h2 id=84-lumber><strong>84 Lumber</strong></h2><p>In 1956 Joe, his brothers and some partners invested in a lumber yard in Eighty Four, Pennsylvania. They called the business "84 Lumber" and soon expanded into selling building materials and home improvement supplies. After a few years Joe and his brothers bought out the other partners.</p><p>Over the next several decades 84 Lumber grew into one of the largest home improvement chains in the United States. It is currently the largest privately-owned building supplier/home improvement chain in the US. As of this writing, 84 Lumber operates more than 250 stores in 30 states with annual revenue topping $4 billion.</p><p>In 1992, after more than three decades at the company's helm, Joe appointed his daughter Maggie President of the firm. At this time he also transferred 40% of the company's equity to his daughter. He upped the amount to 80% in 1993.</p><p>When the housing market crashed in 2008, 84 Lumber was brought to the brink of bankruptcy. With some restructuring and cost-cutting, the company was brought back from the brink within several years.</p><h2 id=nemacolin-woodlands-resort><strong>Nemacolin Woodlands Resort</strong></h2><p>In 1984, Joe bought a 400-acre resort/hotel complex in Farmington, Pennsylvania called Nemacolin. He renovated the property and re-opened as a luxury resort. Over time he expanded the property to more than 2,000 acres.</p><p>Today Nemacolin Woodlands Resort features three hotels, a spa, an off-road driving academy, a shooting academy, skiing, a golf course, a museum and multiple restaurants. The resort is home to the Mystic Rock golf course which was part of the PGA Tour from 2002 to 2006.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Joe has donated millions to renovate Uniontown, PA.</p><p>He has been married three times and has seven children. His daughter Maggie is still the President of 84 Lumber.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97yaicZqCRp7G6ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-marsden-biography.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>James Marsden Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
