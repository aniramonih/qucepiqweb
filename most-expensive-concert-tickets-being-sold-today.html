While it can be fun to see your favorite music artist live, you have to ask yourself how much you’re willing to spend on tickets.</p><p>From Bruce Springsteen to Taylor Swift, it seems that everyone is headed on tour in 2023. We’ve compiled a list of the most expensive concert tickets so you can learn more about the price points for the various artists and bands on tour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Our Methodology</h2><p>The highest concert ticket prices have been established using a few different sources. In order to create the list, we considered several factors.</p><ul><li><strong>Ticket prices</strong>: We used sources like AllMusic and Ticketmaster to determine what the tickets were being sold for.</li><li><strong>Band websites</strong>: We used many of the band websites to learn about how comprehensive their tour is and what cities they’ll be hitting.</li><li><strong>Music blogs</strong>: We referred to several music blogs to hear about the discussion of concert tickets, including availability and resale prices.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. Peter Gabriel&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Date: </strong>September 30, 2023</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $180</li></ul><p>Peter Gabriel is a GRAMMY recipient six times over, with a whirlwind worldwide “Back to Front” tour in 2012 that bordered on spectacular.</p><p>Formerly the frontman for Genesis, the effects specialist included video screens and other technology along with superhuman energy to excite and exhilarate his audience. There is an inkling of an idea that the artist might be ready to release his new album following the tour.</p><p>Perhaps he might surprise concertgoers with a preview. He’s very spontaneous. His tour started in MAy is long anticipated after a seven-year absence and will last for roughly a month in Europe. The North American aspect of his tour kicked off in Quebec City on September 8.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Arctic Monkeys&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Date:</strong> September 3, 2023</li><li><strong>Price: </strong>$198</li></ul><p>The first single for the Arctic Monkeys immediately went to No. 1 on the singles chart in the UK. The infectious “I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor” had their fanbase and the press touting them as “the next big thing.”</p><p>Everyone waited with great anticipation for the album released shortly titled “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not.”</p><p>The band album, “The Car,” is their seventh released album, with the “orchestral rock.” The tour has focused on UK, Ireland, Europe, and North America.

Fall Out Boy&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Venue: </strong>Climate Pledge Arena</li><li><strong>Date:</strong> March 1, 2023</li><li><strong>Price: </strong>$5000+</li></ul><p>Fall Out Boy has had a significant amount of success as an emo rock band since 2001 when they formed. Now, with a new cover of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” they emerged on a large world tour for 2023. Since that success, they added more tour dates to continue throughout 2024.</p><p>Many venues have sold out, with VIP tickets averaging about $300 for the experience to be one of the first ones in with merchandise. As events sell out, the floor seats become highly sought after, often selling for thousands as resales.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Elton John&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Venue:</strong> AAMI Park in Melbourne</li><li><strong>Date: </strong>January 13, 2023</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $349</li></ul><p>The legend known as Elton John started out on a tour in 2020 but was moved around for a few years due to the coronavirus. Now, the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour has allowed him to get back on stage.</p><p>While most of the tour dates covered 2022, he did a few final “encore” shows in 2023, which were all found in Australia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. The Weeknd&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Venue: </strong>Auckland, New Zealand</li><li><strong>Date:</strong> December 9, 2023</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $791 (not for VIP experiences)</li></ul><p>The Weeknd has played 4,000 + shows today with a GRAMMY-winning “Starboy” album under his belt. He has toured worldwide with many artists beginning in 2011 with Drake on stage in Toronto. “Dawn FM” is the artist’s latest album, released roughly a year ago, leading him on the road.</p><p>They gained a significant amount of popularity after playing at the Super Bowl in 2021. After their halftime show, they decided to focus on going back to the studio – and now, they have a tour for 2023.</p><p>While he spent the majority of last year supporting the album, The Weekend intends to continue the “After Hours Til Dawn Tour with a second leg that started in June when he’ll be in Manchester and then head to Latin America and Europe in the fall. Dojo Cat will be his opener across the full tour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Coldplay&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Venue:</strong> Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, Jakarta</li><li><strong>Date: </strong>November 15, 2023</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $2117</li></ul><p>The British band is beloved worldwide with massive accolades, top-selling covers, many tours, and numerous awards.

Not only is he entertaining but he was also the front for One Direction, which was popular for years – and still holds a cult following within the music world.</p><p>In 2023, you can anticipate seeing the tour to promote “Harry’s House,” released in 2022, navigating through Europe and the United Kingdom, hitting the stage with “Wet Leg and Koffee.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5.

However, as a result of some heath problems, many of the tour dates have been postponed to 2024, which only makes the tickets even more sought after.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Beyonce&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Venue: </strong>MetLife Stadium, New Jersey</li><li><strong>Date: </strong>July 29, 2023</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $6134</li></ul><p>Simply put, this artist prescribes to one of the most dynamic and entertaining performances concertgoers willingly ascribe the highest price points to participate in.</p><p>She is headlining a tour for the first time in seven years to support “Renaissance” from 2022.

The authentic young woman has established herself as a savvy entrepreneur but has never strayed from “never meeting a stranger.”</p><p>She hasn’t been in concert since 2018 making “The Eras Tour” much anticipated and difficult to get tickets for. It will be her first time out since releasing albums including “Midnight, Folklore, and Lover,” with the billing touting the tour as “a journey across various musical eras.”</p><p>It started in Arizona in March, with tickets currently being virtually impossible to find and prices outrageous if you can find them.
