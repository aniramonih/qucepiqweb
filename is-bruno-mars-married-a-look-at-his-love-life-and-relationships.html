So, in this article, we have explored everything there is to know about his love life, both past and present.</span></p><h2><strong>Does Bruno Mars Have a Wife?</strong></h2><p>Bruno Mars, whose real name is Peter Gene Hernandez, does not have a wife because he is not married. He also does not have an ex-wife because he has never been married before. Bruno Mars was born on the 8th of October 1985 and is presently 38 years old. His age and massive career has contributed to the reason many people simply conclude he is married.</p><p>But there is no truth in that, as the music boss is yet to walk down the aisle with any woman. Bruno has, however, been involved with several women in the past, including ones in the entertainment industry, and while he actually dated some of those women, some others were mere rumors and speculations.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jessica Caban Has Been Bruno Mars’ Girlfriend For Over a Decade, But They Are Not Married</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bruno Mars has for over a decade been enjoying a peaceful and happy relationship with Jessica Caban, an American fashion model, actress, and fashion designer.

Meanwhile, another source reports that the two first met at one of Bruno’s concerts or music video shoots.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Whichever is the case, the fact is that Mars and Caban fell in love the very first time they met. The singer asked Caban out after he was said to have followed her around in the restaurant for a while. Jessica accepted, and they started dating and have had a beautiful relationship to date. The duo has occasionally been seen out in public attending events together.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They also have been featured together in several magazines as a couple.

Significantly, they have not courted any controversy, including infidelity rumors, ever since they came together. Regardless, On different occasions, the pair have publicly expressed that they are very much in love and enjoy spending time together.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In honor of their tenth anniversary in October 2022, Jessica shared a rare detail into their love life when she posted a throwback photo of herself and Bruno and captioned it,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Polaroid of our first trip together, 10+yrs ago”</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. The duo is very committed to each other in their relationship despite not having tied the knot yet.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jessica has often said that she admires Bruno for his hard work and dedication to his career and how successful he has grown in music. She has also spoken highly of the love and bond they share a couple of times.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jessica Caban Inspires Bruno’s Music</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Beyond being in a romantic relationship, Bruno Mars has severally said that his girlfriend, Jessica, is the inspiration behind some of his biggest hits. Jessica’s influence can be heard and felt in some of his songs, like&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Just the Way You Are, Marry You,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>and</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Grenade</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. The lyrics of these songs and others are usually interpreted as a reflection of their relationship.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To say the least, Jessica Caban’s presence and influence in Bruno Mars’ life have been requisite to the success of his career. Bruno credits Jessica with the height he has reached in his life and music. She has been with him right from the time he was climbing the ladder of his music success. And today, they are enjoying an incredible life at the top.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bruno Mars is a recipient of 15 Grammy Awards, four Guinness World Records, four Brit Awards, 14 Soul Train and 11 American Music Awards.

Bruno has sold more than 130 million records across the globe, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bruno and Jessica Do Not Have Children Together Yet</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite being together for a long time, Jessica Caban and Bruno Mars do not share any children. In fact, none of them has a child of their own yet; this is quite distinct from the story of a typical celebrity romantic relationship where the couple sometimes are even together for the sake of their children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Many people, especially their fans, have wondered the reason behind this. While some believe this is an intentional decision they made for themselves, others speculate that they’ve been trying to have kids. Whatever the case, the essential thing is that they are simply living their best lives together and, significantly, flourishing in their respective professional careers. They live together in Bruno Mars’ home in Los Angeles, California.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When Are Bruno Mars and Jessica Getting Married?</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Fans and the general public have since been looking forward to hearing Bruno and Jessica break the news of their wedding date, but that has yet to happen.

Regardless, they are living nothing short of a married couple’s life.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The two love birds are simply taking their time to make decisions for themselves, and when they are ready, they will certainly share the news with their fans. Meanwhile, a few sources allege that the duo got married in a secret ceremony. We think this claim came about because Jessica has, in some of her interviews, referred to Bruno as her “husband.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, the truth is that they have not exchanged marital vows but recall that we said they are living nothing short of a married couple’s life and are deeply committed to each other. In one of his recent interviews with Rolling Stone, the multiple Grammy award-winning singer was asked if he would ever propose to his girlfriend Caban, and he answered, “</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jesus! She’s my best friend. My rock.

There is no denying the fact that some of these women would even be the ones running after him.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For Bruno, the case is not different, although he manages to keep it low-key, unlike a few other highly successful and famous singers such as Chris Brown.
