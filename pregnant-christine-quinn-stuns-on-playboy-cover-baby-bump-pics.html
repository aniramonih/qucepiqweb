She has continued to show her pregnancy progress via Instagram, from yoga sessions to <a href=#>TikTok videos.</a></p><p>“I’m going to be a mommy,” Quinn captioned an Instagram slideshow earlier this month. “My heart is already bursting with love and gratitude for this little life inside me. I’m humbled, awestruck and inspired. It’s already a feeling like no other that I’ve ever experienced, and all I can think about is how we can be the best parents possible. We can’t wait to start our family!”</p><p>The reality star went on to write that she knew motherhood would “change [her] for the better,” explaining, “I can’t wait to experience this next chapter together as a family.”</p><p>The Netflix personality recently told Us exclusively that <a href=#>she has been “energized”</a> while expecting her first child. “I’m feeling great,” she gushed on March 4. “I’m doing my best to stick to my routine, but I’ve noticed during pregnancy, I was low on a few things, like, vitamin D and iron. So, I’ve been taking supplements and that’s been really helping me feel great.”</p><p>Quinn was “definitely” nauseous in her first trimester, she added at the time. “I wasn’t sure what part of it was pregnancy [and] what part of it was food because I’m really sensitive to food. It was definitely heightened, and my appetite changed a lot, so it wasn’t really fun.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology grad, 41, <a href=#>secretly tied the knot in December 2019</a>. Eight months later, Quinn told Metro that she hoped to have “two boys.”</p><p>The model gushed in August 2020: “I can’t even imagine, like, trying to tame a little Christine. I always wanted two little boys just because I’m actually, like, quite a tomboy myself. I grew up playing sports, I love cars and I fly airplanes. I love all the boys’ stuff, I always have. I was really athletic growing up, I ride horses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkvbOxxqeYp6xdmLWztdKtoKedXabCqrrNZqqtrZ6oerC6jKmjmrGSpMZur86vnKtlkpavunnBrqSpZaCesLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-cattermole-net-worth-at-death.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Cattermole Net Worth At Death</span></a>
