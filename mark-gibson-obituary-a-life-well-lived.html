Born on April 8, 1970, to Marcell and Shirley Gibson in Louisville, Mark was a loving husband, father, son, brother, and grandfather who left an indelible mark on the lives of those he encountered. With his magnetic personality, tireless work ethic, and zest for life, Mark’s memory will forever be cherished by those who had the privilege of knowing him. Mark was an unapologetically outspoken and vibrant presence in the lives of all who knew him. His straightforward nature was paired with a perpetual smile that brightened any room. Mark was a man of action, always brimming with energy, and he could never sit still for too long. He possessed a strong work ethic and a dedication to his family, community, and his own business ventures.</p><p>One of Mark’s greatest sources of joy was spending time with his best friend and beloved wife, Trish, at the Ponderosa Boat Dock on Nolin Lake. This special place held a special spot in his heart, and it was there that he found peace and solace in the company of loved ones. Whether it was cruising on the water or enjoying a tranquil day by the lake, those moments with Trish were some of the most cherished times in Mark’s life. In addition to his passion for the lake, Mark was a dedicated entrepreneur. He took great pride in founding and managing his own gutter business, Gibson and Son. Mark’s commitment to his business was emblematic of his strong work ethic, and he was loved and respected by the entire community for his unwavering dedication.</p><p>Mark was a man of diverse interests and hobbies. He was an avid fan of the University of Kentucky Wildcats, and he cherished the moments he spent cheering on his beloved team. In addition to his sports enthusiasm, Mark enjoyed off-roading, an adventurous pastime that allowed him to explore the great outdoors and experience the thrill of adventure. Mark had an eclectic taste in music and could often be found listening to a variety of genres. Music was not just a form of entertainment for Mark; it was a source of solace and inspiration. His eclectic taste in music mirrored his zest for life, celebrating its diversity and richness.</p><p>In the wake of Mark’s passing, there is a profound sense of loss that reverberates through the hearts of all who knew and loved him. He was a pillar of strength, a beacon of positivity, and a constant source of support and love for his family and friends. Mark is preceded in death by his father, Marcell Gibson, but he leaves behind a vast circle of cherished family and friends who will hold his memory close to their hearts. Mark’s legacy lives on in those who loved him, and the impact he had on their lives will continue to resonate through the years. Left to cherish Mark’s memory are his loving wife, Trish Gibson; his son, Doug Gibson; his daughter, Meagan Duvall; and his four beloved grandchildren, Braxton Pearson, Kaylor Duvall, Zaylei Gibson, and Ben Gibson. He is also survived by five brothers, Paul, Sammy, Tony, Donnie, and Frog, as well as three sisters, Rhonda, Tina, and Lou. Mark’s legacy extends to his mother, Shirley Thompson, and his in-laws, Sandy and David, who shared in the joys of his life. His best friend, Christopher Lewis, who stood by his side through the ups and downs of life, will forever treasure the memories they created together. Mark’s influence also reaches the many nieces and nephews who looked up to him and the extended family members and close friends who were fortunate enough to share in his journey.</p><p>A funeral service to celebrate the life of Mr. Mark Edward Gibson will be held on Monday, October 30, 2023, at 7 PM at Legacy Funeral Center – Schoppenhorst Chapel, located at 1832 W. Market Street, Louisville, Kentucky. Friends and loved ones will have the opportunity to pay their respects during visitation hours on Sunday, October 29, 2023, from 11 AM to 7 PM at the funeral home. Visitation will also be available on the day of the funeral service, from 11 AM to 7 PM. In times of loss, it is through the sharing of stories, memories, and support that we find solace.
