She is best known for her role of Dr. Camille Saroyan, head of the Forensic Division, on the forensic crime drama Bones. Her first appearance on Bones was in the first episode of the second season. In the first six episodes of the season, she was credited as a guest star because creator and writer Hart Hanson had planned to kill her off in episode twelve when Howard Epps, a recurring serial killer, poisoned her in order to create more tension and drama between the two main characters. However, the response to Taylor's character Cam was so strong that the writers offered her a position as a recurring regular in the show. From season 2 episode 7 through the finale, she was credited as a main character.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-249696 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GettyImages-847178768.jpg alt="Tamara Taylor" width=594 height=408 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-249696 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p>She also appeared in the CBS medical drama 3 lbs as Della and the UPN series Sex, Love & Secrets in the role of Nina, both of which were short-lived.
