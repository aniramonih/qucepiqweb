As much as people have adored them, they have received immense hate from the online audience.</p><p>Lexi and Hayden are the latest couple whom <a href=#>TikTok</a> users adore to despise. These two, who posts under the name <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@lexi and Hayden</a>, have a devoted following because of their unusual way of living.&nbsp;</p><p>They share a camper in Oklahoma and have recently started working different jobs at night.&nbsp;</p><p>Hayden works until 5 a.m., and Lexi works until 7 a.m., as she explained in this video. They typically go to bed when she gets home from work and doesn’t wake up until 2:30 or 3 p.m.</p><p>Other interesting details about the couple involve Hayden playing video games frequently and Lexi enjoying singing.</p><p>They also have an Alex, their shared dog. Although it is unknown when they were born, Lexi stated that she was 19.</p><p>She also wished Hayden a happy 21st birthday in September.</p><p>The duo has more than 137,500 followers but also some detractors. On Reddit, disparaging discussions about the pair have already begun to increase.&nbsp;</p><p>There is now an entire community called r/Lexi and HaydenSnark Lounge.</p><p>Lexi made movies about “Hayden’s sibling” evicting them or something similar before they moved into one’s travel trailer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lexi and Hayden on TikTok received hate</h2><p>According to the r/Lexi and HaydenSnark Lounge, most of the hostility appears to be directed at Lexi, the account’s main face.</p><p>Lexi is despised because her <a href=#>stories</a> frequently contradict one another, and she begs, stating that “they can’t afford groceries or laundry, but then goes out and buys a $200 gaming monitor,” according to a commenter.</p><p>Someone in another thread noted that Lexi was sporting an <a href=#>Apple watch</a> despite claiming to be having financial difficulties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hayden-and-lexi-tiktok-1024x576.jpg><p>More purported reasons why people weren’t too fond of the couple, especially Lexi, were provided by one user in a later post.&nbsp;</p><p>“They keep expired food in their refrigerator and cook uncooked meat on the stove. They simply don’t clean up after themselves, despite the fact that she calls herself a “housewife,” and yet she gives him a pb&j for lunch,” the user entered.</p><p>Additionally, users criticized Lexi for allegedly lying a lot in her videos.</p><p>Someone wrote: “It’s just a collection of odd, little lies. That raises the question, “What is the purpose of that? “Why lie?”&nbsp;</p><p>She once asserted, for instance, that she was an only child, a granddaughter, and no cousins.</p><p>Then she claimed to have a single cousin, which is strange.</p><p>According to other users, she allegedly makes up the details of cleaning the camper and attending class.</p><p>Things became nasty when Lexi allegedly started circulating false information online regarding Hayden’s cousin Hayley Wertman.</p><p>Hayley and Lexi seemed to engage in physical contact. Additionally, a Reddit user going by the handle u/Pine apple-bra and claiming to be Hayley posted the following in the group: “If any of you would like some tea. Tonight, Lexi attacked me for challenging her!”</p><p>They don’t get along, despite the fact that what happened between them is unclear.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC4xLGgZpmemXqprdidnKdlpJ64tbvKaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./koo-hye-sun.html><span>←</span><span>Koo Hye-sun Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Family, Facts</span></a>
