And they&nbsp;started to talk&nbsp;to wedding planners for their special day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But the&nbsp;MacGruber&nbsp;actor and his fiancee had to put talks on hold as everyone else was canceling their weddings because of the pandemic. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then their daughter came along in April 2021. However, the couple was never in a hurry to get married. Not really.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They did impulsively think they should get married at times. “Let’s just do it,” Forte admitted to thinking during his talk with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a> in December 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The right time wasn’t there yet.</p><p>2021 was already halfway done,&nbsp;and Forte and his&nbsp;then fiancee had waited enough. So, a few weeks before his parents’ scheduled visit, they started planning a surprise wedding.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The couple&nbsp;was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His closest friends were also there because they worked with him on MacGruber (a TV series serving as a sequel to the 2010 film of the same name). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Forte and Modling thought, “Let’s&nbsp;just have this wedding, surprise my parents.” and decided to go with the wedding last minute.</p><p>He surprised his parents, who did not realize they were attending a wedding until they pulled up to Jorma Taccone’s house. The house became the wedding venue for their small, delightful wedding on July 31, 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Forte was enjoying married life when the interview with People took place. He felt like he was already married to his now wife, but being actually married was enjoyable. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The part he most enjoyed was calling Modling his wife. He also loved another thing — wearing the wedding ring.</p><p>He gushed about how he had found the right person in his wife. "I needed to find somebody who was a very patient person and she's the most patient, understanding woman in the world,," Forte said of Modling.</p><h2>Will Forte and Olivia Modling's Relationship</h2><p>Forte and Modling's relationship began after meeting at a party in 2018. They took a while but eventually became serious in 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engagement followed</a> shortly after. They got engaged over the holidays in 2019.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Will Forte with his now wife Olivia Modling in December 2019.</strong> (Photo: Mary Steenburgen/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, Forte and Modling weren't the first to confirm their engagement. It was his father, Reb Forte. He revealed his son was engaged during their appearance on ABC's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in April 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He even joked that if they had a baby boy in the future, they had agreed to possibly name him Orville Willis Forte V. Forte is the fourth with the same name, and Reb is the third.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Unfortunately for Reb's wishes, Forte and Modling's first kid was a daughter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>On February 15, 2021, the couple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed their daughter</a>, Zoe Douglas Forte. However, he waited until his <a href=# rel=follow>Conan</a> appearance in April 2021 to talk about her birth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK%2BZobluss6rq55lp56zpnrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-beckham-launches-my-dad-had-a-rolls-royce-t-shirt.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Beckham Launches 'My Dad Had a Rolls-Royce' T-Shirt</span></a>
