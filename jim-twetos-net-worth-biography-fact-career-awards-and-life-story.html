Born in Wichita, Kansas, Jim Tweto grew up in Silver Bay, Minnesota. An avid hockey player, he eventually won a hockey scholarship to the University of Alaska-Anchorage, and moved to Alaska when he was 18. While in college, he began shifting his focus to aviation, and he subsequently relocated to Unalakleet, Alaska to focus on flying in the early 80s. He married and started a family in Unalakleet, and in 2009, became the COO of the largest regional airline in Alaska, called Era Alaska. The airline is a combination of three smaller carriers that merged, Frontier Flying Service, Hageland Aviation, and Era Aviation. In early 2011, Mr. Tweto and his family became the subject of a documentary series on the Discovery Channel called “Flying Wild Alaska”, and their family-run airline. The show ended up airing 31 episodes over three seasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn7auedOwnK2no2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrOir9NmmpqqlZq%2Fbq3Wmqmdq12Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerome-benton-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jerome Benton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
