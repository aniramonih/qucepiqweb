He never was shy to be himself around anybody and it just spoke volumes to his authenticity. The days of school or practice when everyone had low-energy, he was the person that filled that void and brought everyone’s spirits back up and remained motivated. He was never afraid of failing and stood up to everything with his head high. I also can’t remember a time when he didn’t have a smile on his face, even when things didn’t go how he planned. I admired those things about him and so much more. He’s someone that i wanted to model myself after. Someone who wasn’t scared to be who he was and spread love to someone he maybe didn’t know. Someone who never thought twice about helping out anywhere he could. I appreciate everything he did and was. He was a great friend, teammate, role model, and amazing brother. You’ll be missed, bro</strong></p><strong>– Wrote by Trystan Summers-Vitzelio</strong><p>The heartbreaking news of Brandon Followell’s passing was confirmed by his mother, Monica Followell, through a sorrowful announcement on her own Facebook page.</p><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Lemarcus Pettus Died: What Was His Cause of Death?</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Obituary_And_Funeral_Arrangements></span>Obituary And Funeral Arrangements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details regarding the funeral arrangements and the obituary for the remarkable young man are still pending release to the public, as his family members take the time they need to navigate this difficult period.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqkZ%2ButLDEp6uapJOkua2xxp5lnKedZK%2Bzrc2dpqdllqS5rbvWnqOlZZSesqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./subway-founder-fred-deluca-dead-67.html><span>←</span><span>Billionaire Subway Founder Fred DeLuca Dead at 67</span></a>
