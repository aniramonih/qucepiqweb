But as these sites are not always legal, as they often serve copyrighted content, they regularly switch their URLs.

The site closed down on June 13th, 2023, with the site‚Äôs team sharing a basic message announcing their decision to end Soap2day for good.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúHello guys: We have decided to close Soap2day forever.

So, all that is left for us to figure out is the elephant in the room ‚Äî why did the site close down?</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Well, bluntly speaking, the free movies and TV series were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not legally acquired by Soap2day</a>, thus it violated copyright laws, and watching the same on the site was deemed illegal. Such sites are explicitly blocked in many countries and in fact, accessing content on the likes of Soap2day is a punishable offense that can lead to penalties, fines of $100,000, and even jail time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>As mentioned above, such sites continuously change their URLs to avoid copyright theft crackdowns. It won‚Äôt be far fetched to assume that Soap2day possibly couldn‚Äôt evade the same any longer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Boasting illegal content isn‚Äôt the only reason such pirate websites are not secure. Even though Soap2Day called itself ‚Äúas one of the most secure free movie streaming platforms just like YouTube, Google and Netflix,‚Äù the countless pop-ups that opened when one browsed or tried to watch a title didn‚Äôt actually come with the confirmation that they won‚Äôt lead to a virus or compromise your private data.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>So, even though there are a trillion more pirate sites out there, given the perils that accompany them and the fact they effectively strip content creators of the justified credit that they rightfully deserve, it is still not late to switch to the ever-expanding legal streaming libraries and VOD options.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqiZoGexosWMnKOoq5WZeqmt0maqqJmgZ7GixYysn66sXZm8uLqMn6arZZekvKV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-mcmurray-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Sam McMurray Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
