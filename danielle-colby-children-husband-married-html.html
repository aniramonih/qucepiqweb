However, injuries forced her to give it up.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Today, she is an American reality television personality and burlesque dancing. While not appearing in the series, Danielle can be seen performing burlesque with her troupe, and also on tours with her band. Her busy lifestyle and as well as her love life has prompted the show's fans to question if she was leaving the show for good. Details of which you will soon find out.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Daniell’s History With The American Pickers Was A Coincidence</h2><p>Danielle Colby-Cushman came to the spotlight after she was cast in the antique treasure hunting show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">American Pickers</a>&nbsp;(2010).&nbsp;</p><p>Danielle was not just the sex-appeal of the show. In a show filled with men, she was also the main person to hold the store together. She was the witty woman who made sure their treasures were in order while the two duos,&nbsp;Mark Wolfe and Frank Fritz, went out treasure hunting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While the show has been on air since 2010, Danielle became a part of the show only when it was sold to History Channel.&nbsp;Danielle was a close friend of co-star Mike Wolfe&nbsp;before the concept of the show had even&nbsp;been imagined.</p><p>She&nbsp;first met Wolfe at a garage <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sale</a> over 15 years ago.&nbsp;At the time, Danielle was looking at a lamp and thinking about whether to buy it or not. As she put it down for a moment, Wolfe scooped it up and quipped,&nbsp;"The time to buy it is when you see it."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After the show was created and sold to the History Channel, Wolfe asked Danielle to work at the office of the antique shop Antique Archaeology. The show premiered in 2010 and went on to become a major hit; Danielle getting praise for her chic and savvy personality.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Burlesque Dancing Is In Her Blood&nbsp;And Still Pursues It</h2><p>Prior to becoming the TV star that she is, Danielle Colby-Cushman was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">burlesque</a> dancer.&nbsp;</p><p>Danielle’s desire to become a burlesque dancer arose when she attended a burlesque performance starring comedian Margaret Cho and dancer Satan’s Angel while living with her family in Chicago. &nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Later, Danielle had dabbled in a risky sport that she would later abandon. She owned a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">roller derby</a> team with other “Irish girls” called the Big Mouth Mickies for three years. She decided to leave the team when she realized that a roller derby player’s “shelf-life”, as she puts it, was only about three to five years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>So, she formed a burlesque troupe with the same girls and they named themselves <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Burlesque Le’ Mustache</a>. Later, in 2014, she also formed a burlesque <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">academy</a> called Dannie Diesel's Bump And Grind Academy, designed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">teach</a> burlesque to other would-be enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite her TV career, she hasn’t given up on her dancing dreams. Burlesque is still in her blood as her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">profile</a> and Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posts</a> seem to suggest.&nbsp;</p><h2>Danielle Has Put Her Passion To Good Use To Increase Her&nbsp;Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>Danielle boasts an estimated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $1.5 million to $2 million, as per Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Her prominent source of income is definitely her stint as the savvy store-keeper.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reportedly</a>, she earns $15,000 per episode, making her annual salary just over $54,000.&nbsp;Her Pickers co-stars, Wolfe and Fritz, reportedly earn $500,000 and $300,000 per season.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The show isn’t just her only source of income, though. Being the adventurous person that she is, she also owns and operates a retro clothing based company, 4 Miles 2 Memphis. She is also an ambassador for Batey Girls — a jewelry design program dedicated to empowering&nbsp;women facing&nbsp;sex trafficking and domestic violence within the Dominican Republic.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On top of that, Danielle also seems to be earning a significant amount pursuing her actual passion. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Comparably</a>, the average salary of a burlesque dancer is around $34,000. Couple this with the money she makes selling autographed posters and mercs on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, her net worth of $1.5 million seems to pan out.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>If that were not enough, Danielle&nbsp;also hits the road touring with her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">band</a>, Gin Rummy.</p><h2>Danielle's First Marriage Broke Down Due To Her Immense Publicity</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Danielle's first husband was Kevin Colby. She was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pregnant</a> with her first child in 1996, and gave birth to their son, Miles, on 2 September 1996. Four years later, she was pregnant for the second time, and this time they welcomed a daughter&nbsp;named Memphis&nbsp;to the family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Once Danielle's showbiz career started to take off, her husband did not enjoy the amount of attention she brought. This led to rifts in their marriage, which finally ended in divorce in 2004. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Danielle didn’t close the book on her love life despite her first failed marriage. She remarried a few years later to French graphic designer and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">artist</a>, Alexandre De Meyer.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The two started living together in Chicago after their marriage. Danielle’s two children from her previous marriage and one niece also filled the house. The duo was adamant about providing them with a stable family life that they could relish. But things didn’t go well for them and the pair later separated without any official news about a divorce.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Currently, Danielle has been openly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating</a> Jeremy Scheuch. She can be seen vacationing with Scheuch. Although&nbsp;this was good news as it meant that&nbsp;she was having the time of her life, it, however, did prompt an important question from the fans that was a little&nbsp;disconcerting... <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Has Danielle left American Pickers in 2020?</h2><p>There has been much hype surrounding Danielle’s current status with the show. Since the show’s production has been halted in light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, not much up-to-date information can be found regarding the show’s status.&nbsp;</p><p>The rumor of Danielle's departure&nbsp;was from&nbsp;Danielle’s vacation with her boyfriend itself. Her latest <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> seems to suggest that she is in Puerto Rico with her current boyfriend, Scheuch. While that by no means suggests that she is leaving the show, her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with The New Times did strongly hint at the new direction that the show might be going in.</p><p>In the interview, when asked about the possibility of a “Danielle spin-off” in the future, she replied that she was open to whatever the future held. She added that though her job at the Antique Archaeology shop was cool and all, she strongly felt that this was not the last job that she would have. She had a contract with the show and she would honor it. But finished off by saying that she would indeed love a spin-off.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mur7XEpaOeZZOkuaPFjJyfoqSUp7KveceuqpuZnpl6rq3Rq6CenF6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dan-quinn.html><span>←</span><span>Dan Quinn</span></a>
