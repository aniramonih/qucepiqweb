However, we know that she was born in Belgium and holds Belgian nationality. Other than this, no information about her birth facts is known to us, But, she gave birth to Romelu Lukaku on May 13, 1993, in Antwerp, Belgium. And, he is now 20 years old.</p><p>The name and information regarding Adolphine’s parents are also not available until now. Similarly to that, information related to her siblings, cousins, grandparents, relatives, and any other family members is also not available to date. It can be understandable because she only became popular and known because of her son. Otherwise, she was just a normal person. So, there is very little information about her early life and birth facts.</p><p>Regarding Lukaku’s educational background and qualifications, no information has come forward until now. However, considering her becoming a mother and all, she must have graduated at least school and high school or she could have been a dropout as well.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222257 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Adolphine-Lukaku-Romelu.jpg alt="Adolphine Lukaku" width=650 height=903 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222257 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Adolphine Lukaku posing for a picture with her son (Source: HLN)</p><h2><span id=Adolphine_Lukaku_8211_Career_and_Professional_Life>Adolphine Lukaku – Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Adolphine Lukaku’s career, as well as professional life, is unknown as of now. As we know she only became known after her son became popular so, her career life is also private and not available. However, we do know that she is an amazing mother and an awesome housewife as well. She loves taking care of her family and loves her son, Romelu very much. Other than this, no information is available about her professional life.</p><p>Talking about her son, Romelu Lukaku is a professional footballer from Belgium. He plays as a striker for Serie A club Inter Milan, on loan from Premier League club Chelsea, and the Belgium national team. He started his senior club career playing for Anderlecht, where he was able to win a Belgian Pro League title and finished as the league’s top goalscorer. Romelu also was able to join Chelsea in a transfer worth £10 million (€12 million) in the year 2011.</p><p>However, the limited playing time resulted in loans to West Bromwich Albion and Everton. So, in the year 2014, he went on to sign with Everton in a then club-record transfer worth £28 million (€32 million), going on to finish as the league’s second-top goalscorer. During his career, he also was able to win a Serie A title and a Serie A Most Valuable Player.</p><p>Moreover, during the quarter-final of Coppa Italia, the former Manchester United teammates, Romelu and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, had a heated discussion. In between the arguments, Zlatan brought Lukaku’s mother into the middle of the debate.</p><p>Son, Zlatan was shown a red card, whereas Lukaku was suspended as he invited Zlatan for a fight. This incident deeply upset Adolphine Lukaku so, after the incident, she asked her son to win the match at any cost and get revenge on Zlatan.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-222256 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Adolphine-Lukaku-Son.jpg alt="Adolphine Lukaku" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-222256 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Adolphine Lukaku with his son, Romelu Lukaku (Source: 7sur7.be)</p><h2><span id=Adolphine_Lukaku_8211_Relationship_Status>Adolphine Lukaku – Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Adophine Lukaku tied the knot with <strong>Roger Lukaku</strong>.
