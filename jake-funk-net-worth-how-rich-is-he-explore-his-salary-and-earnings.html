In December 2023, the Baltimore Ravens signed him to a practice squad at a base salary of around $200,000. With rookie running back Keaton Mitchell missing due to injury, the team may employ Funk in the game as an option.</p><p>Jake Funk, an NFL running back, graduated from the University of Maryland (2016-20). In the 2021 NFL Draft, he was selected in the seventh round by the LA Rams. Funk joined Tutu Atwell, Ernest Jones, Bobby Brown III, and Robert Rochell as Rams draft picks, signing a four-year contract.</p><p>He spent a season under head coach Sean McVay before being dismissed by the Rams in the second year of his contract. Funk remained on the practice squads for the New Orleans Saints, Indianapolis Colts, and Miami Dolphins.

The New Orleans Saints then signed him to their practice squad (October 12-November 8, 2022) before placing him on waivers for $46,000. Then, for the remainder of the 2022-23 season, he alternated between the Indianapolis Colts roster and practice squad.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Funks_Salary_with_the_Baltimore_Ravens_in_2024>What Is Funk’s Salary with the Baltimore Ravens in 2024?</span></h2><p>On December 19, 2023, the Ravens signed him to the practice squad as a prospective roster addition under head coach John Harbaugh.
