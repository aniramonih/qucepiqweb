<a href=../../../../does-crimson-pygmy-barberry-have-thorns-html.html></a>
Answer
Crimson Pygmy Barberry is a little shrub that grows in the shady areas of the forest. The Crimson Pygmy Barberry (berberis thunbergii autropurpurea nana) is a low-maintenance landscaping shrub that looks wonderful in any setting. However, since the plant needs minimal upkeep, you are unlikely to come into contact with the thorns very frequently. Simply said, don’t plant Crimson Pygmy Barberry in areas where little children are likely to walk.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/post/page/106/>← Prev Page</a>
