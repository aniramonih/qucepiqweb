If you have a sister — or a best friend who’s close enough to be your sister — you can probably relate to Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility. The story of Marianne and Elinor Dashwood, sisters who would do anything for the other yet are completely different, is a beloved favorite and the basis of Emma Thompson’s award-winning film adaptation. Maybe it isn't usually thought of as romantic like Austen's other novels, but there is a special place in my heart for Sense and Sensibility.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A. J.
