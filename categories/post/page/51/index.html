<a href=../../../../vera-putina-cause-of-death.html></a>
Vera Nikolaevna Putina, born on September 6, 1926, rose to prominence in 1999 when she claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was her son.&nbsp;This allegation contradicted Putin’s official biography, which indicated that his parents died before he took office.
While Putina’s assertions may be false or part of a publicity effort, they do highlight holes in the known narrative of Putin’s past. According to the official account, Putin’s parents were already in their forties when he was born, leaving a ten-year gap between the births of their previous sons, Albert and Viktor, who both died as children.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Walk like a peacock</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

Answer
In an ideal world, the lock would appear horizontally when it is locked and vertically when it is unlocked. This is the widely acknowledged standard across the majority of the globe. In reality, this is more dependant on the lock’s maker and the time and location in which it was made.
