After <a href=#>TMZ</a> posted new photos of <strong>Jason Trawick</strong> eating pizza and “showing off his new gut,” the ex-fiance of <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to thank the website for encouraging him to lose weight.</p><p>“Thanks @tmz I needed this,” he wrote on Jan. 20. “Started my diet/workout program today. C u in a month!” The former agent also shared a screenshot photo of TMZ’s article, and a photo of himself lifting up his shirt and showing off his bare belly.</p><p>Trawick and Spears, 32, called off their engagement last January. During their relationship, Trawick lost an incredible amount of weight and showed off his lean, muscular bod. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> exclusively reported in April 2011 that he shed 50 pounds since he began dating Spears in 2009. The “Till the World Ends” singer told <strong><a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> </strong>at the time that she and Trawick “love to work out” and go on walks together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Spears’ <a href=#>ex-husband <strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>, who is the father of their sons Sean, 8, and Jayden, 7, blamed his headline-making weight gain in 2006 on their messy split.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Everybody knows what happened with me and Brit. I’m not going to say that’s the total cause of it but, I mean, just not being happy with myself was probably the main part of my depression,” he <a href=#>told Access Hollywood</a> in 2010. “Once you get depressed, you don’t really feel like doing anything. You’re kind of discouraged about yourself and then the weight gain too, or that makes me more depressed . . . I mean, it’s a combination of all of those things.”</p><p>Since Trawick’s romance with Spears ended, sources exclusively told Us in November 2013 that he was <a href=#>dating Hunger Games actress <strong>Leven Rambin</strong></a>. Spears, meanwhile, has been dating Virginia native <strong>David Lucado</strong> for about eight months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKGaq5%2BjerW%2BwLCgnKNdm7miv8eeqmaenJavo8WMm5ylpKliwLWt0a2qZpyZmsFurc2dZLCnoqC8tsCMqamon6KWum6txa2cq2WSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnSqaOirF1nfXKAkWpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacqui-jeras-everything-you-need-to-know-about-her.html><span>←</span><span>Jacqui Jeras- Everything You Need To Know About Her</span></a>
