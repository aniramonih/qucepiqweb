実際に今のラルクファンの女性の多くは、 hydeさんがラルクの入り口になっています。
しかし、バンドのことをよく知っていけばいくほど、
KENさん筆頭にtetuyaなど他メンバーも好きになっていきます。
ラルクのあの名曲は全てhydeさんが作ったのではないか？と誤解されてることが多く、
実際にはギターのKENさんの作曲能力、アレンジセンスの恩恵が強いのです。
hydeさんさんがソロがVAMPSでラルクのような曲にならないのは、
主に、ラルクではKENさんメンバーの濃い才能が隠れているからなのです。
特に言われるのは、
「KENって天才じゃないか？」という話です。
hydeさんがカリスマ性ならば、
KENさんは確実に才能の人なのです。
では、具体的にKENさんのどの部分が天才的なのでしょうか？
KEN(ラルク)の作曲能力は天才級？ ギタリストのテクニクやリフ、ソロのセンスの話になれば、
KENさんの名前はなかなか出てきません。
しかし、作曲センスの話になると、
KENさんの名前は確実に登場します。
ラルクそのものが天才の集まりだとしても、
KENさんの一般受けは頭一つ抜けています。
主にKENさんがラルクで作曲した曲といえば、
winter fall、NEO UNIVERSE、花葬、浸食～lose control～、接吻、Lover Boy、LOST HEAVEN
、叙情詩、DAYBREAK'S BELL、雪の足跡などがあります。
どの曲もラルクをよく知るファンにとって大切な曲で、
一度聞いたら忘れないポピュラーさもあれば、
ラルクでしか生み出せないグルーヴ感の詰まった曲ばかりです。
hydeさんとのコンビが絶妙なのも良いですね。まるでhydeさんの詩と声のためにだけにオーダーメイドされたような、 hydeさんにしか魅力が伝えられないような曲を多く作ります。
KENさんの作る曲は、カラオケが上手い人でも、
あまり手を出して欲しくないような、
何か、特殊なオーラを放っています。
メンバーの中でも作曲能力が頭一つ抜けてると言っても、
その才能はラルクの中だからこその才能なのかもしれません。
KENのフェンダーストラトのモデルギターと機種(画像) KENさんが愛用してるギターといえばストラトキャスターです。
最近ではシグネイチャーモデルが発売され、
KENさんファンの間で爆発的に売れました。
youtubeの「弾いてみた」系の動画で、
そのKENさんモデルのギターを抱えてる人を何人かみたことがあります。
KENさんのモデルのギターの名前は、
シグネイチャーストラトキャスター「Galaxy Red」で、
２０１０年に初めて作られ、２０１１年に一般的で発売されました。
Galaxy Red最大の特徴とも言えるボディフィ ニッシュ、特注のピンクアノダイズド・ピックガード、ブラックパーツによるルックスを完全再現。さらに 9.5インチラジアスのメイプル指 板や、オリジナルのネックシェイプ、ヴィンテージフレット、SPERZELのロックペグなど、Ken自身の実機と同じスペックで演奏性を再現しています。引用元：https://shop.fender.com/ja-JP/product-galaxy-red
値段は１７万を超えますが、かなりリーズナブルな価格帯まで落としてます。
ギター好きな人に手にとって欲しいという純粋な気持ちが垣間見てれ素敵ですね！
仕様もルックスも完全にケンさん好みということで、
今後、長く浸透されていくことでしょう。
KENのギター技術・テクニックは下手なのか上手なのか。破壊級の魅力が特徴 KENさんの作曲能力、アレンジ能力が天才的なのは知られた話ですが、
ギターのテクニック、技術的な部分での評価はどのようなものなのでしょうか？
一部では下手と言われていたり、
