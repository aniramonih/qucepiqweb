Jerry is said to be “freaked out” at how much time Jessica is spending with her friend Madonna, and worries that the aging pop star is “corrupting” the mother of his three children:</p><p>[Jerry Seinfeld] is blaming the just-divorced Material Girl for “corrupting” the mother of his three kids, who’s become Madonna’s new BFF, sources tell The Enquirer. “Jerry’s wife Jessica is suddenly spending a lot of her time with Madonna and her new toyboy Jesus Luz, and Jerry is freaked out!” a friend divulged.</p><p>“He doesn’t like Jessica staying out until all hours of the night and meeting people he doesn’t know. He’s afraid Madonna is corrupting her.”…</p><p>And now Jerry’s fretting that Madonna’s 22-year-old Brazilian beau will bring more hunks to the party.</p><p>“Jerry’s worried that with Jesus tagging along, more toyboys will spice things up,” said another insider. “he dreads Madonna encouraging young hotties in tight pants to make nice to his wife.”</p><p>[From The National Enquirer, print edition, May 11, 2009]</p><p>After the way these two treated the woman whose book Jessica ripped off, I couldn’t give a crap if they broke up or not. Part of me is wishing that they’ll have some kind of high profile divorce in which we learn about all of their transgressions and Jessica is awarded 1/2 of Jerry’s fortune, forcing him to sell off his Porsche collection. That’s an awful thing to say though, so I’ll just feign disinterest in the state of their relationship.</p><p>These two met at the gym when Jessica was newly married and didn’t waste any time. She broke up with her poor husband to get together with Jerry. He knows she’s capable of cheating and probably has that in the back of his mind while she’s out partying with Madonna. Serves him right.</p><p>Madonna is shown below outside the costume party dressed as her daughter, Lourdes.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/29055pcn_madge16a-1-header.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbXFiaIJwtsSrqbKXo5q2r7LEpZuYrJieu6y%2FvqaYnaeeo66gtdKYmqiqoqq9tbXNoJahoaOUxKqyxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-break-silence-private-serenade-video-leaked.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Lopez speaks out against guest who leaked private wedding ceremony video</span></a>
