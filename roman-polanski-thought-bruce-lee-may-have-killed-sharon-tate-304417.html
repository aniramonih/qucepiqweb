Among Bruce’s students were Jay Sebring, Steve McQueen, and Roman, and Bruce also helped Sharon for her film, The Wrecking Crew.</p><p>In the summer of 1969, when Tate was brutally murdered by the Manson Family, the then-29-year-old director briefly suspected that Bruce played a role in her undoing. Reportedly, this alleged fact is included in the plot of the upcoming film from Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.</p><p>The movie revolves around Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor living across from Tate and Polanski, who, alongside stunt-man Brad Pitt, run into the Manson Family as well as Mr. Bruce Lee. Through various interpersonal relationships in the industry, Lee, Polanski, and Tate knew each other and wanted to collaborate back in the late 60s.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0GVCmxBw08/</p><p>In the book, Bruce Lee: A Life, written by Matthew Polly, Tate invited Lee to have dinner with him and believed they would get along. They became friends and Lee, later on, became a pillar of support to Mr. Polanski following Tate’s brutal killing.</p><p>On the 9th of August, 1969, Polanski was in London, England, researching a project and Tate, Sebring, Voytek Frykowski, and Abigail Folger were killed at the couple’s home in Cielo Drive in LA. At the beginning stages of the investigation, the police didn’t know who committed the crimes, however, Tate’s friends and Roman had many theories.</p><p>Polanski had discovered a pair of prescription glasses at the home, and later, when he was training with Lee, Bruce said he had needed a new pair of glasses because he lost them. Due to his emotional state at the time, Polanski considered Lee as a possible suspect.</p><p>Krakowski said that it didn’t surprise him that Roman believed Lee would’ve been responsible, because, at that time, Roman was highly suspect of many people. Polanski coyly offered to take Lee to his ophthalmologist for glasses, and he discovered the prescription wasn’t the same, therefore, eliminating Lee from the list of potential suspects.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>By the 1st of December, 1969, Manson and his cult members were detained by the authorities in connection with the crimes. They were all found guilty.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipLqiuoyppqWZnqi4qnnToaaun5ipeqO%2B1JycZqSVmnqurdhmn5qulWK4qrjLnptmq5iWv7C6jK2YrZ1daH11gJBwZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rex-ryan-wife-michelle-foot-fetish-video-star.html><span>←</span><span>Rex Ryan's Wife Michelle: Foot Fetish Video Star?</span></a>
