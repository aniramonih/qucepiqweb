According to Melly and his lawyers, the government violated strict procedural rules by failing to provide adequate notice that they intended to do so.</p><p>The rapper’s legal team argued to the state supreme court that they should hear the case because it involves issues of “great public importance” that go beyond Melly’s specific charges. Melly’s attorneys, Daniel Tibbitt and Philip R. Horowitz wrote in a brief filed on January 27 that it is in the clear interest of everyone defendants, victims, lawyers, judges, etc. to have precisely defined and easily understood rules.</p><h2>Is YNW Melly Released From Prison?</h2><p><strong>YNW Melly’s release date from prison has not been announced yet.</strong> His devoted following will be overjoyed to hear that he will be freed from jail in 2023.
