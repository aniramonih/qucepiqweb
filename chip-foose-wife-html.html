His innovative design firm Foose Design&nbsp;has been on the map since 1998, right before when he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inducted</a>&nbsp;into the Hot Rod Hall of Fame. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But his success is not a result of his singular efforts. His wife and manager, Lynne, seems to have played an equally important role.</p><h2>Who Is Chip Foose's Wife?</h2><p>Lynne is&nbsp;the&nbsp;vice&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">president</a>&nbsp;and corporate financial officer&nbsp;of their designing firm, Foose Design, Inc. A force to be reckoned with, she has made a mark in a typically male-dominated industry. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lynne <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduated</a>&nbsp;from Orange Coast community college in 1990. With a major in&nbsp;organizational psychology, she ventured into&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;business at the age of 23. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She opened a restaurant, Giovanni‘s Pizza, in collaboration with her brother and monitored the business part while her brother handled the culinary factors.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After taking care of&nbsp;the restaurant for four years, Lynne stepped down from her role and moved back to her hometown, where she <a href=# rel=follow>married</a>&nbsp;Chip, her long-time&nbsp;boyfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She utilized leisure in the early years of her marriage and attended the Western State College of Law in Irvine, California. As soon as she got her law degree, she opened a firm that would later be the family business. She ran it&nbsp;till 1998.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Lynne Is an Essential Part Of Chip's Business</h2><p>It would only be fair&nbsp;to say that Foose Design, Inc. wouldn't have been there if not for Lynne. She had an equal contribution&nbsp;in founding the company the year their&nbsp;first child was born.&nbsp;</p><p>Lynne managed all the licensed and legal permits for the organization. Since they couldn't hire any people due to low finance, she worked multiple roles. She was a&nbsp;receptionist, bookkeeper, CFO, secretary, and in-house counsel on top of being a mother to an infant.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The business escalated in 2003 when they got to shoot for&nbsp;Overhaulin’. The show became an instant hit with three episodes airing on TLC per month. But three episodes that lasted eight days each meant more work.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As a believer, Lynne didn't succumb to the pressure; she persevered and handled all tasks as a working mother —&nbsp;ultimately helping the company to be a brand.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Chip considers himself lucky to have a wife like Lynne.&nbsp;In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Motor Week Chip, he claimed he needed her expertise for the profit to be soaring. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, in another&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;in 2016, he mentioned how Lynne looked over his firm and career's financial side, claiming that she “cut up all her credit cards” once to curb his spending. He also said he only held one credit card to this day because of his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Likewise, he highlighted his wife's importance in a 2019 anniversary&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>&nbsp;on Facebook.</p><p>We couldn’t run Foose Design without you(Lynne)!</p><h2>Through Thick And Thin</h2><p>Lynne’s significance in Chip’s success extends way beyond just her managerial position. As a wife, she has provided emotional and mental support to Chip and has been there with him on every step.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>When asked about&nbsp;challenges in his career, he said during the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2016 SEMA</a> show that it was “finding the right people to help [him]," and he was lucky to have found Lynne. “I am extremely grateful that I married the right woman,” he added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Back when they were dating, Lynne was the one who&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">encouraged</a>&nbsp;Chip to finish art school.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He had dropped out from the&nbsp;Art Center College of Design in Pasadena after the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">death</a>&nbsp;of his younger sister from Progeria. But when things went back to normal, Lynne persuaded him to join the college and get his degree.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Now, Chip attributes his decision to go back to college to his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She wanted to marry her equal… so I knew I had to figure out how to get back to the Art Center, and it’s the best thing I ever did in my life.</p><p>Lynne&nbsp;and Chip have&nbsp;a beautiful family of five, including two&nbsp;kids&nbsp;—&nbsp;son Brock Foose and daughter&nbsp;Katie Foose.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1qryMn6aoq5VixKqyxGefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audrey-hale-death-photo-are-the-viral-pictures-fake.html><span>←</span><span>Audrey Hale Death Photo Are The Viral Pictures Fake?</span></a>
